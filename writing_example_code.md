"It would be helpful if you could put together a working code sample. Just something simple would be fine."

Sounds easy, right? 

Reader, I am here to tell you: it is not easy.

I've noticed a few GitHub repositories now have `examples/` or `samples/` directories, as well as entire GitHub repositories that are code examples. This is great since these approaches are user friendly and also version control friendly. It's also helpful because while developers don't always read documentation or READMEs, they _will_ try to install, execute or tinker with code. Providing example code that work "off the shelf" is a great way to actually show what your code will do and how it should work.

I'm learning lately, however, that writing such example code is actually not easy. Here are some reasons why:

1. Not Knowing Your Audience
2. The Copy/Paste Conundrum
3. You Ain't Gonna Need YAGNI
4. DRY Isn't So Spry
5. Keeping Up Appearances (and Being Up To Date)

Over the next few posts, I'll explore each of these points as they relate to example code. For the purposes of these next posts _example code_ is defined as 

    _code written to demonstrate a software library or package for individuals inside and outside of a particular project_. 
    
This could mean that the sample code is publicly available online to anyone, or available to everyone within a large organization. The key difference between example code and other forms of code is that it's meant to be shared and used as documentation, not just "in production" code. Since learning and doing are two different activities, learning how to use a piece of code or how it works versus using the same piece of code can be very different experiences. I'm going to share what it's like producing example code and how to create better example code for everyone.
