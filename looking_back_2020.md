Usually, around this time of year, folks start posting blog entries and discussions around predictions for the next year. I think it's safe to say that predictions of the future can sometimes be a bit...underwhelming, based on [_broadly gestures_] all this. 

Instead, I'm going to take a look back at 2020 and post some deeper thoughts I've had during this whopper of a year. 

## Pandemic

- This year I read [_The Great Influenza_ by John Barry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Influenza). It's quite good, if slightly too long and in need of editing. One thing that I keep coming back to in it is how much is similar from the 1918 pandemic in the COVIN-19 pandemic, and not in a good way. Public health officials being outright ignored by politicians who think fears are overblown. Massively unintended consequences to poor public health decisions. And folks just not _getting_ that masks, social distancing, good hygiene and stopping large gatherings _work_ in reducing disease spread.  

- My painfully cynical opinion on pandemic handling and results is that over time, effectively nothing will change and the next pandemic 100 years from now will basically have the same amount of suffering for most people, at least in the West.

- There has been _so many dishes_ to wash this year. So. Many.

- One thing I've really come around to is that the Roaring 20's/Jazz Age wasn't brought about from folks celebrating a war victory (propaganda) but from folks surviving and dealing with fallout of a world-changing pandemic (much more likely explanation).

- One of sadder yet enlightening aspects of this year is realizing how many mundane things I miss now that I cannot do them. Here's my list of things I miss a fair amount:

  - going to the gym,
  - sitting in airports and having a snack/drink before a flight,
  - weekends at an AirBnB with friends,
  - Trader Joe's, and
  - dining in restaurants (even bad ones).

## Software and Tech

- It's official: I think the test framework tool of choice is [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io). This applies to _any_ team starting out with browser/native app test automation. WDIO is the closest thing I've seen to a "batteries included" testing package/framework. With its service ecosystem, you can test web and native mobile apps, plug into services and create nice reporting in a fairly easy way - while using the same API/UX. Plus it has an active, helpful community!

One interesting aspect of WebdriverIO's superiority is that only a few years ago, I held the opinion that writing browser-based tests in Javascript should be avoided altogether, due to asynchronicity in Javascript and the state of Selenium tooling at the time. Things have changed in JS indeed.  

- The Selenium project is _complicated_. 

- I never, _ever_ want to design a programming language myself from scratch. Not my journey. I think I get the _appeal_, but definitely not for me.

- Something that's due for a comeback: Ruby on Rails. RoR really created the concept of a "turn-key" web framework, with all layers present with reasonable defaults. Why there no NodeJS equivalent yet?

- On a similar note, a while ago I listened to the ever excellent [Postlight](https://postlight.com/podcast) episode where Paul Ford contemplates [why cloud-based software tooling is so complicated](https://postlight.com/podcast/life-in-the-clouds-the-present-and-future-of-cloud-hosting-services). He also theorizes that there is some major innovation possibly waiting for "smart packaging" of these services together into something higher level. To me this is the next step of Ruby-on-rails turn key approach, where it happens at the tooling/infrastructure level.

- An interesting aspect of software development that doesn't get enough attention is sample code writing. As in, code that is written primarily for demonstration purposes. It is not trivial to write and maintain good sample code.

- This could be a spicy take but whatever: test tooling needs to stop "optimizing for Java". Due to the Java language (object-oriented, statically typed) and ecosystem (incredibly large user community, Java projects not always easy to setup from scratch, comparatively difficult to release utilities to MavenCentral), writing a "modern" test automation harness is not as straightforward as it is in Java as it is other languages/ecosystems (NodeJS, Python or Ruby come to mind). Many teams could benefit by looking at these different ecosystems and building a project using them instead of Java.

- Test automation tooling is hot in the software word, and hot in the business world. There's even been [a major scandal](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/Startup-failures-fraud-theranos-heaspin-zenefits-meltdown/) involving a testing tool company. I honestly did not see this coming.

- Tool choice in test automation, in my opinion, is still critically important to the success of test automation efforts. 

## Personal Life

- I'm following the pattern of posting more personal thoughts to Medium, which you can read about [here](https://joshin4colours.medium.com/january-to-now-70e8738bad1f). Of course this year I've had thoughts about the pandemic and how that's impacted my life. 

- At the beginning of this year, in January, I set a goal for myself to travel less for work. As of March, a travel ban was placed across my team and office due to the pandemic. Be careful what you wish for, I suppose.

- I also set a goal to read more books this year, which also got derailed by the pandemic. Among the best books I've read this year are _Super Pumped_ by Mike Isaac, _The Collected Works of Billy the Kid_ by Michael Ondaatje, _The Great Influenza_ by John Barry, and _The Skin We're In_ by Desmond Cole. I also thoroughly recommend _I Hear She's a Real Bitch_ by Jen Agg, which is low-key one of the better management books I've read. 

- I've never been a big video gamer in my adult life, but that has been slowly changing, particularly with my son's interest in Minecraft. Honestly playing video games with him has been (IMO) beneficial for both of us. He gets to be creative, work on hand/eye coordination and have a bit of good old fun. I get to spend time with him in a common interest and get a bit of insight into how his critical thinking works. Surprising, but I'll take these benefits of video games all day long.

- Having a new baby during a pandemic: don't recommend this, in general.

- Fuck cancer.

- Mental heath is _still_ health. If nothing else, this year has shown how massively important it is.
