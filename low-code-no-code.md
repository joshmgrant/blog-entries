Much more seriously, the always insightful Postlight podcast had an episode dedicated to [low-code and no-code solutions in software development](https://postlight.com/podcast/going-codeless-is-this-the-way-of-the-future). It's a really good summary of some tools and trends around "low-code" (needing to write only small pieces of scripting or code to make an application work) or "no-code" (using approaches other than writing scripts in programming languages). 

Since such solutions are a hot topic in software testing at the moment, I thought I'd share some opinions I have on them. 

Paul Ford made a really good observation in the podcast above, saying "It seems to be thereâ€™s a level of complexity whereby you just need a lot of the things that *programming gives you*." [emphasis mine]. In my experience with record/playback tools and similar "low-code" approaches, good ones can take your testing and automation efforts pretty far (even mediocre ones can actually make life harder for you) but eventually you will hit a wall. Paul's insight is that programming helps overcome that wall, and while it isn't the _only_ way to potentially overcome shortcomings of low-code/no-code approaches, it is _very good_ way to overcome it.

So one of my big opinions on low-code/no-code solutions for test automation is as follows:

> *Eventually, you will need to write some code and need to understand how to write such code*

If you're using a low-code or no-code solution, you may not need to know how to write code today, or tomorrow, but you will some day. 

One of the biggest drawbacks and pain points to many record/playback solutions is that when the time comes to move to scripting or programming, tooling support just isn't there. I have a sinking feeling that a lot of no-code testing solutions will be similar. Maybe there will be some breakout stars among these tools, but maybe not.

Let's see what the future holds on low-code and no-code testing tools.
