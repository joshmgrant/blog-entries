This month's theme is character. In many cases, an individual's character is determined by themselves and their environment. Where a person is and the circumstances they face can greatly affect how they feel and act. Peter Drucker, a notable management theorist, once said "Culture eats strategy for breakfast". For me, this means that the circumstance we face greatly affects what we do; even well-laid plans with good intentions can fail due to the culture around us. This is good advice when dealing with many different situations, and a helpful tip when working in groups.
