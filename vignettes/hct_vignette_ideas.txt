This month's theme is character. In many cases, an individual's character is determined by themselves and their environment. Where a person is and the circumstances they face can greatly affect how they feel and act. Peter Drucker, a notable management theorist, once said "Culture eats strategy for breakfast". For me, this means that the circumstance we face greatly affects what we do; even well-laid plans with good intentions can fail due to the culture around us. This is good advice when dealing with many different situations, and a helpful tip when working in groups. When working on a particular issue, that issue appears in a particular context. That context might affect the issue more than any actions may.

Empathy is difficult. That is, being aware of how other individuals feel and sharing your feelings with theirs can be quite difficult. Still, empathy is important enough to sometimes require hard work to keep it up. As an example of working hard on improving empathy, *Facebook now has an empathy team* [] which is responsible for helping software developers empathize with Facebook users. In turn, software developers can build software that's more enjoyable and easier to use. Whether in the digital or physical realm, focusing on being empathic with those around us can be challenging but pays off by helping us connect with others.
