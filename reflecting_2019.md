It's that wonderful time of year again. The holidays are here in North America and we're getting ready for a new year. This time the new year is 2020, and lots of folks are reflecting not just on the past year but the past decade. I won't be doing that other than: I've come a long, long way from studying the evolution of [cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation) and writing scripts in SilkTest.

Instead, here are some thoughts of mine as I reflect on 2019.

## Software Development

- Browsers are hard.
- NodeJS and NPM have built quite an empire. One key characteristic of empires, however, is that they eventually fall.
- Autonomous personal cars might as well be the new flying cars: overpromised and underdelivering.
- User Experience and Developer Experience are going to have a moment next year, if they haven't had one already.
- Strong teams can make any methodology and tooling work well.
- I'm still irrationally ecstatic that so much good stuff from Microsoft can run nicely on Mac and *nix systems.
- Python is still excellent and I continue to hold this opinion openly.
- Ruby is becoming the next Perl, but in all fairness Perl is the original scripting language turned awesome programming ecosystem so this isn't exactly an insult.
- I'm slowly gathering an appreciation for Java anc C#, particularly Java tooling.

## Software Testing & Automation

- Test automation is harder than you think, even taking into account this point.
- I'm OK with cancelling James Bach at this point. Even if he's done good work in testing, his time has come and gone.
- More continuous delivery across the industry will lead to a "re-discovery" of (good) exploratory testing.
- Writing good automated tests in isolation is about 10% of their value. The rest is how test automation is used and how teams work together with automation.
- This year could be The Breakthrough Year of excellent automated test helper libraries like [Selenide](selenide.org), [Watir](https://watir.org) and the like.
- I'm still waiting for API test automation to take off once people figure out it's actually pretty great.

## Parenting

- My kid being four and starting school is exhausting, joyous, complicated and amazing.
- Paul Ford's [comment](https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/1179740603426451456) that the first years of raising a child is similar to having a mild brain injury really struck a chord with me. It's one of the best descriptions the impact raising a young child has on a parent I've seen.
- On a related note to the above, North Americans really need to get onboard the parental leave trend. I cannot even begin to talk about the benefits individually and culturally.
- I never did get into Star Wars when I was a kid, but I'm somehow making up for it now, if not by choice.

## Personal

- Mental health is health, and I've said it before but I'll say it again: take care of yourself
- I don't get to say out loud too often: I really do love my current job, team and company
- I realized the other day 2005, 2015 and 2020 me would really disagree on a lot of stuff. And that is ok I think.

## Canadiana 

- This [thread](https://twitter.com/DesmondCole/status/1189580860456087552) by Desmond Cole discussing the narratives after this year's federal election gave me pause. He was discussing the election outcome but really this applies to almost every facet of Canadian culture. Ontario (mostly Toronto area) and Qu√©bec are extremely important _of course_, Alberta and BC are sometimes important, and the rest of Canada just sort of doesn't matter. This is such a bummer to me.
- The idea that Canada is "too small" or "just not a big enough market" economically or culturally is slowly becoming hogwash and will eventually just be an excuse for incubments to keep the status quo.
- One of my favourite books this year was [Maximum Canada](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/book-reviews/review-doug-saunderss-maximum-canada-argues-the-more-the-merrier/article36510614/). I thoroughly agree with Doug Saunder's point that Canada should simply have a lot more people in it.
- Calgary and probably Edmonton could become interesting destinations that drive growth, if these places allow that to happen.
- Cannabis legalization has been pretty uneventful overall in my experience, which is a good thing.
- I'm still amazed so many tourists love coming to Toronto.
