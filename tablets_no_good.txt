Here's a tech prediction: developing /primarily/ for tablets as a platform will lead to tears and heartbreak. 

This came up today when I noticed a *question on Twitter* [https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/601451680203309056] from Mathew Ingram. The question asked what people thought of newspapers betting on tablets as a platform. I responded by saying betting on tablets as a platform was "short-sighted and technologically over-complicated". Allow me elaborate. 

I've written before about *tablets as a possible missed opportunity for software developers* [http://simplythetest.tumblr.com/post/65399662402/are-tablet-apps-a-missed-opportunity]. That was a while ago, and I feel like things have progressed even further. Developing specifically for tablets has gotten worse, not better. 

For starters, let's define building things for a "tablet". What does that mean? The way I see it, it means one of two things: 1) building for iPad or 2) building for...all other platforms with a vague nod toward particular hardware form factors. 

The iPad is easily the most popular tablet around if we *consider sales* [https://gigaom.com/2011/07/22/android-vs-ipad-the-tablet-sales-figures-that-matter/]. It has the most brand recognition and is widely popular. However, iPad sales have been *in decline* [http://www.businessinsider.com/apples-ipad-sales-decline-again-2015-4] recently. Some are speculating that the iPad has plateaued, and perhaps even going to be superseded by other Apple products like larger-screened iPhones. Apple being Apple, the support for iPads could change swiftly; support could be discontinued at any point. This means developing for only iPad means tying yourself not just to single platform, but a single device on a single platform. This is a highly risky strategy with dubious benefit. Even bailing out and trying to switch to more general iOS devices might not be that direct. 

The alternative approach of building for any mainstream tablet isn't really much better. First, you have to grapple with what mobile developers already know is a big pain point: several completing platforms. You'll have to decide what tablets to support and go from there. Of course iPad means iOS, and potentially larger iPhones. What else? Android means dealing with *fragmentation* [http://mashable.com/2012/05/16/android-fragmentation-graphic/], so supporting many OS variants for the near future. It also means that popular Android tablets - existing or newcomers - might be updated at varying rates, which is a large tech cost for developers. 

Beyond Android and iOS, the terrain gets murkier: what about BlackBerry, and it's *tablets* [http://www.knowyourmobile.com/mobile-phones/blackberry-passport/22747/blackberry-passport-review-dont-believe-haters]? Does the Microsoft Surface count as a tablet? If so, you're now developing for Windows. What if some other crazy OS appears and takes significant marketshare, or a major one drops out? 

This is what I meant by technologically over-complicated. You've got about a dozen hard choices to make before you've even decided on how to put ads in...I mean, how your business model will work. I won't even start on whether tablets overall will continue to have the same popularity now as in the future. 

Tablets are a perfectly valid form factor now. People enjoy using them and they're a first-class member of many larger ecosystems. But betting on "tablets-only" will almost certainly be a losing bet.
