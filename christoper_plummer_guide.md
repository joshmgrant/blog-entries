How you decide what events to go to? 

This is a tricky question for most people, but even more so for people who go to events as part of their job. For example, developer relations advocates often present at conferences to tell people about their cool projects (like for example a [AI-guided fuzzing tool](https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/cifuzz)). However, there are only so many hours in a day, and only so many events someone can attend in a year. How can you choose the events that work best for you?

One approach that I think works well is to take inspiration from one of the greatest actors of a generation: Christoper Plummer.

The late but great actor Christopher Plummer took every kind of acting role you could imagine: large scale [blockbusters musicals](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/) to [European dramas](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488380/?ref_=nm_flmg_t_41_act) to [Shakespearian plays](https://stratfordfestivalreviews.com/blog/2021/02/05/the-stratford-festival-remembers-christopher-plummer-photos-and-video/) (and even some [lesser quality films](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079946/?ref_=nm_flmg_t_160_act)). When asked how he chooses roles in an interview, Plummer said a role needs to have one of three characteristics: the role is interesting enough, pays well, or is in a great location.

This is how I think about events, and I think the Christoper Plummer rule works well. Stated for choosing developer events, you should consider going to an event if the event

- is interesting,
- pays well, or
- is in a great location

## Interesting Role (or Event)

Developer events and conferences come in shapes and sizes and cover all kinds of topics, from the most narrow programming construct to the broadest area of industry. Depending on your interested or priorities, there are likely a few "major" events or conferences that take place on a regular basis. For the Python world there's PyCon, for the infosec world there's DEFCon, and so on. These events draw a lot of people and event simply showing up without a plan may still be beneficial. These major conferences and events are definitely something to consider, even if you've never attended or aren't overly familiar with them.

## Pays Well

Sometimes conferences will pay for speakers to attend, and in some cases this includes food, accommodation and travel expenses. Similarly, most conferences look for sponsorship from potential partners and vendors and in turn provide conferences passes. If you have the inclination to speak to people, from onstage or from a table, you may be able to attend a conference at very little out-of-pocket cost. Who doesn't love free stuff? Finding opportunities to go to conferences at little to no personal cost might help make them more attractive to you. 

## An Interesting Location

Have you ever wanted to visit Disney? Then going to a conference or event in Anaheim, California or Orlando, Florida might provide the perfect reason to visit. Many places draw visitors for business or pleasure based on local culture, commerce or climate. If an event happens to take place in somewhere interesting to you personally, it might tip the scales in your favour of attending. A great location also makes a less valuable event seem a bit less bad.

If all the world's a stage, then consider these three things when choosing where you'd like to be a part of the play.
