If you've ever watched a James Bond film or similar, you've probably seen a scene that involves the villain pushing a big (usually red) button causing an underground lair to self-destruct. The villain usually pushes the button toward the end of the movie, giving only a few seconds for the hero and others to escape certain death.  Pretty dramatic. 

This technique works great for the likes of Dr No. It works much less effectively for software development teams.
