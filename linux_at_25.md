This week, [Linux turned 25](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/on-linuxs-25th-anniversary-development-has-gone-corporate/). It's kind of a big deal, so I thought I'd share my experiences with Linux.

At one time in my life, I was a full-time Linux user. For about three years, I used Linux full time as my OS. Smart phones weren't ubiquitous yet, so using a desktop or laptop was still a big part of my life. At home I used Ubuntu and at school (full-time grad student) I used CentOS. I had a Windows dual-boot on my personal computer but I rarely used it. 

Fast-forward: yesterday I realized that not only was I using only Microsoft OSs, but at work and at home I was using the _same_ OS, Win 10. Quite the change. 

(Full Disclosure: I do have an Android phone, which is technically Linux. But I'll focus on the desktop environment here.)

I also had a short discussion on [Twitter with Bodil](https://twitter.com/bodil/status/766979142319505409) about the current state of Linux on the Desktop. As an obviously experienced *nix user, she details some of the ups and downs she's had with recent Linux OSs and tooling. Eventually she mentions how she's happy with her Chrome OS machine as it basically keeps itself working without much intervention. For me, this is kind of the opposite of most Linux OS experiences I've had. 

To paraphrase her ideas, I think I've hit that age. I really enjoy an OS that _just works_ without much work on my part.

I think this why using Linux didn't stick with me, despite loving it early on. I can still remember finding out how much stuff was included on my first Linux install by default. It was amazing! I could write in LaTeX! I could write Perl scripts! When I learned about apt-get and being able to add new programs _just like that_, it was heavenly. The sky was the limit! Who cared that it took three hours to get my wireless card working? 

Over time it turned out that I did, actually.

Being able to choose your own desktop GUI front-end seemed like a joy when I was in school with a ton of free time. Now I can't even imagine it without shaking my head. 

Linux is still a fantastic environment for software development. There's a great consistency to using a terminal-based OS to work on software, and using Linux was the first experience I had really learning how computers actually worked. I'm grateful I was able to get that experience and make use of it in a good environment. My grad school department had a Linux system admin so I could even get help when had issues, and both my supervisors used Bash all the time. As far as Linux experiences go, it was a pretty positive one. 

I still occasionally use Linux. I feel like [Bash on Windows](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DevelopersCanRunBashShellAndUsermodeUbuntuLinuxBinariesOnWindows10.aspx) will make me use it even less frequently. It's almost a throwback to a particular period in my life. I think I can live with that.
