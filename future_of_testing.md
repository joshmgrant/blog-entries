Lately, there's been some discussion around the Future of Software Testing, and what testers can expect to see in the future. I'm weighing in based on my own experience and what I see around me with my prediction, which is:

*The future of software testing isn't testing.*

I'll explain what I mean through my own personal experience. 

Over the past few months in my current role as test developer on a small-ish team, here are some things I've done:
- Built a custom service-level test framework
- Trained co-op/interns on using our development environment
- Performed test sessions that resulted in filing bugs against development builds of our product
- Taken support calls with beta users
- Developed a pull request-based pipeline for executing automated tests
- Discussed process around where tasks should fit as part of a Kanban workflow

In the past, I've had the following experiences working as a test developer:
- Maintained and executed GUI automation scripts
- Became a specialist on my team's source control system and practices
- Reviewed daily automated test results looking for issues in nightly builds of an application
- Written articles for publications on software testing practices
- Wrote unit tests for a codebase needing better code coverage
- Contributed code documentation to large OSS project

For the most part, I've had roles that include "test" in the title, and was a part of QA teams or groups within organizations (as opposed to, say, development or engineering). Which of the above roles *look* like tasks a testers should do? 

In my opinion, any of them could be tasks for a tester. 

Which leads me to what I think the future of testing is: 

*The future of software testing isn't testing*, but *doing whatever a team needs to increase and maintain quality*. 

This is where the future for most testers is heading. The future isn't converting manual test cases to automated test cases, or spending all day exploring an app. It *may* include *some* of those things for *some* testers *some* of the time, but those tasks don't completely define the future tester. The future also isn't one concrete thing (AI, automation, and so on) but a constellation of related things.

Now I do realize that in terms of this [excellent AB Testing podcast "interview"](http://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/?p=254), my experience is closer to the Modern Test Manager case than the Traditional Test Manager case (full disclosure: I'm not a test manager in any capacity), but I don't think I'm on the bleeding edge of software testing and development. I just think I'm going in the direction of where software testing is going.
