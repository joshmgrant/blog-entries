# Modern Mathematics

## Introduction
   The Oxford English Dictionary defines mathematics as "". However, mathematics predates English, The Dictionary, and Oxford, and so such a definition must necessarily be incomplete.

   Quipus were a physical mathematical tool used for calculation and record-keeping. The quipu does lack a written number system, and we know numbers exist. We can go back further.

   We could go back to Euclid's Elements, as it is widely understood to be the first mathematical textbook. However, Euclid's writings were based on Ancient Greek knowledge of mathematics, meaning we can go further back to investigate what mathematics is.

   Clay tablets were used by the Babylonaians in Mesapotamia to perform calculations of in a number system base 60. Math could be this old as well, but there is still at least one form of mathematics earlier than this.

   The Ishango bone was the earliest mathematical instrument, used as a form of calendar system. These tally sticks show that mathematics is, in fact, very old.

   _So Why Modern?_ 

   In some senses, "modern" may be defined as "new", as in an approach or form that is new compared to the old. Since mathematics is very old, there are many approaches in math that can be called new. In turn, this could mean there is a rich subject in studying modern approaches to mathematcs. 

   For the purposes of this text, modern math will be defined as the mid 1800s because new things get invented.
