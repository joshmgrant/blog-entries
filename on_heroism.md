As a test developer, I've gotten a lot of experience working with systems and workflows. I'm often less interested in software questions like "How do I make a feature do this?" than "How do I make it a good process for a new feature to be added?". I think a lot about workflows, automation and how people and teams work together to get things done. I like stability, regularity and predictability in how work is done and see these as Good Things for software projects. 

This week I had a realization: I also don't like being a hero. 

There's a phrase I've heard kicking around with respect to project management that goes "If you reward fire fighting, you get a lot of arsonists". It's a good sentiment, and something I've taken to heart. The problem in a lot of these kind of fire-fighting situations is that on the onset, things look *good* for those who are good at fighting fires: they get to come in and save the day (or project, release or build). They get to be a hero, which is a good feeling. But over time, rewarding heroes has drawbacks. 

Eventually the *thrill* of saving the day at the last minute becomes the *stress* of saving the day at the last minute. And the stressful version tends to hang around longer than the thrilling version. 

I've been really fortunate in the past few months to work on a team that prizes boring stability and does not appreciate heroes. It makes a difference in how I approach my work, my team's work and software development in general. It also gives me an appreciation for creating structurally good work and processes. Process gets a lot of flak in software but good processes can save you your skin.

It's also made me realize the benefit of good structural systems. Good systems and processes can help all sorts of people in all sorts of situations, sometimes in totally unexpected ways. The benefits of good infrastructure and systems are difficult to overstate. Building and maintaining structural systems it of vital importance, in my opinion. Systems with constant show-stopper problems that require a heroic "save" from individuals runs contrary to good structural systems.

So I'm not going to try to be a hero.
