# Is Mathematics Numbers?

Years ago, I started watching a TV show called [Numb3rs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433309/). Why? Because it was a television program about a how cops (basically) worked with a professional mathematician, played by the overall quite good David Krumholtz, using mathematical concepts to solve crimes (again, basically). Of course I was watching this. From a mathematical perspective it was pretty solid for the first few seasons at least.

The fact a popular television program could centre around a professional mathematician and his work and the title of the program is _Numbers_ suggests that numbers are so heavily associated with mathematics that numbers _are_  mathematics. Are they?

## Numbers In Everyday Life

It is 7:39 on the 16th of the month. What are you doing?

The above sentence contains numbers, as in numeric characters. Likely, you'd understand in your head what the question was asking and maybe even answered that question. This didn't involve any higher mathematical thinking, or even basic calculation. But it did use numbers. 

From a young age, we learn about numbers. Take a look down

# How We Use Numbers

Numbers are, strictly speaking, a representation of a position within a number system, which usually are associated with some concept of quantity. Similar to how counting does not necessarily lead to numbering, numbers are not needed for counting purposes. Numbers can quantify - there are 3 apples in the bowl, it is 22 degrees outside - but don't necessarily need to be used for this. 

- We see numbers from an early age, reading 1, 2, 3
- In school we see a lot of numbers
  - times tables
  - digital time
  - roman numerals
  - church even!

# We Also Learn Number Systems
- We even learn about how number systems work
  - decimal systems
  - [counting systems](./is_math_counting.md)
  - dewey decimal systems
  - eventually integer and real number systems
  - and so on

## Numbers Impact Our Lives
- Numbers have a big impact
  - bills
  - budgeting
  - and so on
- But math doesn't need numbers
  - Pythagorean theorem
  - Algebra
- Are numbers a helper for mathematical thinking? or the real thing?
  - Obsession with prime numbers. they're prime!

## In Conclusion
I think numbers are a major component of mathematics, but not quite inseparable,
