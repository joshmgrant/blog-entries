# Is Mathematics Numbers?

Years ago, I started watching a TV show called [Numb3rs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433309/). Why? Because it was a television program about a how cops (basically) worked with a professional mathematician, played by the overall quite good David Krumholtz, using mathematical concepts to solve crimes (again, basically). Of course I was watching this. From a mathematical perspective it was pretty solid for the first few seasons at least.

The fact a popular television program could centre around a professional mathematician and his work and the title of the program is _Numbers_ suggests that numbers are so heavily associated with mathematics that numbers _are_  mathematics. Are they?

# We See Numbers Everywhere in Life

- We see numbers from an early age, reading 1, 2, 3
- In school we see a lot of numbers
  - times tables
  - digital time
  - roman numerals
  - church even!

# We Also Learn Number Systems
- We even learn about how number systems work
  - decimal systems
  - [counting systems](./is_math_counting.md)
  - dewey decimal systems
  - eventually integer and real number systems
  - and so on

## Numbers Impact Our Lives
- Numbers have a big impact
  - bills
  - budgeting
  - and so on
- But math doesn't need numbers
  - Pythagorean theorem
  - Algebra
- Are numbers a helper for mathematical thinking? or the real thing?
  - Obsession with prime numbers. they're prime!

## In Conclusion
I think numbers are a major component of mathematics, but not quite inseparable,
