# Why Did MC Escher Like Lizards?

## Background

Several of MC Escher's most famous prints feature lizards, either as a tesselation pattern or as a subject of focus.

Examples:

https://www.wikiart.org/en/m-c-escher/lizard-1, print, 1942

The question is: why? 

There aren't really lizards in the continental Netherlands, and some there are nocturnal. Escher didn't have access to images as freely as today. 

## Theories

Time in the Mediterranean: Escher lived in Italy for many years with this family and traveled extensively around parts of the Mediterranean to observe and study art. This included times in Moorish Spain, Corsica, Sicily and Tuscan Italy. These places are warm climates and do have several species of lizard. 

However the timeline doesn't match up with his art. Lizards began featuring in his artwork during the early 1940s while he spent most of his time in the Mediterranean during the 1920s and 1930s. As he moved to Switzerland and Belgium during the years of WWII, these places decidedly do not have many native lizard species. However, after 1942 his work involving lizards bloomed.

Did he just like lizards in the warm places of the Mediterranean? 

## Colonialism

Another theory is that of colonialism. Escher studied art in Delt and Haarlem in the Netherlands. He studied a combination of architecture, architectural arts and decorative arts, learning woodcutting techniques for print. This means that his training came from a Dutch perspective, and he was immersed in Dutch cultural life.

Meanwhile, the Dutch have a history of colonization of what is now called Indonesia. Among other things (understatement), this meant the Dutch in Southeast Asia had exposure to Javanese art and culture. This included cultures such as Batik, which included art with many symmetries and patterns. As well, a motif in art from Indonesia was lizards in various forms. Geckos and similar smaller lizards are found all over islands of Indonesia, and the warm climate makes them found all over the place, even in the presence of humans. 

It seems to me it's not a coincidence that MC Escher (a Dutchman) had some exposure to Batik art including symmetrical designs including lizards.
