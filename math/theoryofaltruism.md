Introduction: 
- "“And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.”
" Luke 6:31, King James Bible
- Basically the golden rule from Jesus of Nazareth

Thesis: Always cooperate. Always choose altruism.

Framework Approach

Definitions: Probably need to define _cooperation_ and _altruism_ separately
Surprise! They're the same.

Practice:
Humans
- Examples from antiquity
- Examples from non-western civilizations
- Religion vs non-religion
- Collusion as legal concept: cooperation is _too_ good
Nature
- Biological Altruism or whatever the hell
  - Symbiosis as a basis of evolutionary success
Humans as part of nature

Theory:
- Evolution of Cooperation literature

Criticism of Existing Theory
- Basically all of game theory
  - Prisoner's Dilemma as late night dorm room session
    - Institutions are not neutral
    - Can't make everything exogenous
    - Nature does not have institutions
- Effective Altruism is flawed
  - Comparison is not helpful
  - Effective for whom?
  - Too much from the point of view of a privileged western scholar with institutional backing
- Longtermism is basically straight up messed
  - Like seriously people, come on now. Millions of years into the future??
- "When should one _decide_ to _not_ act altruistically?"
  - Normative decision
  - Many mathematical theories can't really answer this
