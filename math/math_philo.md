# A Philosophy of Mathematics

~~Mathematics as we know it today, is simply another form of communication. It is neither written, nor seen, nor heard, nor concrete, nor ~~

--> nah we going old school

# Josh Grant's Phd Thesis in Mathematics

## Thesis: Mathematics is _at least one of_ the key aspects of humanity. Mathematics distinguishes human from animal (please let this be rephrased).

## Literature Review

- Early Forms of Communication
  - Early Artifacts
  - Early Artwork
- Early Tools
  - Bronze, Copper, Iron
- Mathematical Topics
  - Number systems
  - Arithmetic
  - Natural Numbers and Primes

## Themes

- Math as Art
- Math as Written Communication
- Math as Record-Keeping
- Math as Time-Keeping
- Math without Numbers

## Examples:
- Ishango and Lebombo bones: possibly the first calendar(s), the first numeric system(s), first method of recording. Found in Sub-Saharan Africa. First again, for _several_ key concepts.

- The Inca system of the Quipu: no written system, but a "base 10" numeric system. Also a form of record-keeping, again without a written system

- Cuneform of Babylonia: Practical calculations for commerce, number system that can be used for accounting.

- Numberless Societies: Some communities of people exist with no concept of numbers. 

## Concluding Results
- Calls to decolonize mathematics
  - Like if math be racist, we be racist
- Implications for mathematics education
- But seriously though, mathematics is very cool
