Theory of Symbiosis

## Thesis
Symbiosis, like cooperation, is a key element in biological evolution

## Background
- Evolution of Cooperation
- Symbiosis as a concept

## Key Ideas
- Symbiosis is observed in nature, and appears to be evolutionary stable (ie not a transient state of 2+ species)
- However, the theory of why this happens is lacking
  - Theoretical models have basically been discarded as worthless
  - Mainstream theories of cooperation do not apply. Kin selection doesn't work, neither does reciprocal altruism, nor does group selection.
- Is symbiosis really inter-species cooperation?
