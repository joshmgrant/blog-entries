# Is Math Counting?

One of the very first mathematical concepts that people learn is how to count. Being able to count to ten, on your fingers for example, is so easy a child can do it.

I have a confession: Once, in undergrad, I had to take a test on counting. And I failed.

Before I go into this story, let's step back for a moment, and talk about counting overall.

## What is Counting OUTLINE

- Start with the picture of multiple stones
  - Cardinal vs Ordinal
  - Comparison vs Totals
- Counting is natural? Fingers and Toes
- Counting without numbers
  - Two different things
  - Incas had counting without numbers
- No counting?
- Small vs Large vs...very large
  - Enumeration
- Combinatorics
- Supersets? Dice Rolls? The usual
- Ramesey Numbers
  
In conclusion, I failed counting (but it was the hard kind of counting)
