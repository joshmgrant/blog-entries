# What's New in Mathematics? 

It's coming toward the end of the year, and that means there may be some "Best of 2023" articles coming about all kinds of things. 

Why not have something similar for math? What are some of the latest newsworthy pieces in mathematics for this year?

I was going to write this kind of article, but then I realized that mathematics is a discipline that conservatively hundreds of years old and more likely tens of thousands of years old. A year's worth of mathematical progress is a drop in a lake. A small drop. 

Instead, let's take a look at some of the biggest achievements of the past 60 years of mathematics, a somewhat bigger piece but closer to a glass of water in a lake.

## Andrew Wiles _finally_ solves Fermat's Last Theorem

One of the most prominent theorems of European mathematics is Fermat's Last Theorem.

## The Four Colour Theorem is - basically - proven

## The aperiodic monotile

## The Invention of the Rubik's Cube

A beloved toy the world over, this colourful cube was formally invented by [Ern≈ë Rubik](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/the-inventor-of-the-rubik-s-cube-took-this-long-to-first-solve-it-1.5945283), a professor of applied arts in Hungary. First starting as an art project, he found the prototype helpful to illustrate group theoretic concepts, hence making the Rubik's cube the first non-mathematical application of group theory.
