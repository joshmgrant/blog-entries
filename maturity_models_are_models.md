A while back, I saw [this fantastic tweet](https://twitter.com/maaretp/status/1214585053759627264) by [Maaret Pyhäjärvi](https://twitter.com/maaretp). In case you cannot follow the link or see the text, the tweet says

> We’re very happy with our test automation. Using a maturity model, we scored 39/80 - not that mature. One of us is wrong.

I thought this was a pretty good point. When I thought about it some more, I realized this tweet is an excellent way to think about maturity models (or even using models in general).

Maaret points out here that models are really just helpful guides to follow for individuals or teams. Maturity models can be treated by some teams as a path to follow directly, meaning a high score by some maturity model is a goal to be achieved. As someone who is intertwined with such models on a regular basis, I can see the benefits of teams following the guide of a model and reaching objective goals. If a team isn't happy or not seeing benefit with an approach - in this case, their test automation approach - a maturity model can provide a road map to move forward, and provide focus for that team.

However, to paraphrase some people smarter than me, models are all wrong, but some are useful and some are dangerous. The key to getting benefit from such maturity models in test automation isn't to _blindly_ follow their requirements and hope for the best. Maaret compares her team's progress with the maturity models and makes an observation. Their team's test automation approach is working for them but the model scores them low. In this case, it's possible that the model is not only wrong but also possibly dangerous. The trick is being able to recognize this possibility before making poor choices. 

I really do enjoy tweet-sized stories and pieces of advice, and this one is one of the best I've seen lately. Maturity models can be helpful - crucial to success, even - but always remember than they are almost always wrong in some way.
