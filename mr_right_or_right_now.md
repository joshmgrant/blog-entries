When it comes to technology stack choices for developers and teams, we should take some inspiration from the iconic [Samantha Jones](https://www.bustle.com/articles/77262-7-things-samantha-jones-from-sex-and-the-city-taught-us-about-being-confident-independent): Sometimes we're not looking for Mr Right, we're looking for Mr Right Now.

Choosing a tech stack or programming language for a project is a big decision. Not only can it have a significant impact on the project's evolution but it can also be difficult to change later on. There's many factors that go into deciding on a tech stack for a given project. One of them is deciding whether you want Mr Right or Mr Right Now. 

Some tech stacks are like Mr Right. These stacks are built for the long run and for projects that may becoming large and complex. Starting out with these stacks is sometimes slow and - frankly - a bit of a hassle. But in the long run, it's all worth it.

Java and its associated tooling (Ant, Gradle, Maven and the rest) is like this. Getting set up and running with a new Java project always takes me at least as long as it takes to write the code to accomplish a first draft. Setting up ant and maven always takes bit longer than I remember it does. I never import existing projects into Eclipse correctly on the first try. And I always need to write nearly a hundred lines of code to do anything interesting. 

But if you can get past the awkward setup, Java can be worth it over time. Packaging in Java is a breeze. Isolating different parts of a codebase and making them independent projects or dependencies is functionally straightforward. And Java's mature tooling helps efficiently maintain the detailed stuff in medium- to large-scale projects. 

Other tech stacks are more like Mr Right Now. Definitely problematic, will likely cause some pain in the not too distant future, but feels good _right now_.

NodeJS and maybe Python are bit like this. I'll never forget going from scratch to bug fixing on a Node project in forty minutes, including getting dependencies and installing an IDE. I can get a Python project doing fun and interesting things in around an hour, and that includes time remembering how to install virtualenv on Windows. These tech stacks are great for getting stuff done quick and dirty. 

Over time, the trade-off becomes more clear. Dependency management in Node is something of an open problem in software development, even for moderately small projects. And Python package management is still far from perfect, even for modules written and kept in the same environment. In both cases I feel like as projects grow in complexity you find yourself solving the same annoying problems over and over. 

This isn't to say that Mr Right Now can't become Mr Right. Samantha had a long, fulfilling relationship with Smith, just like Facebook has with PHP. Conversely, Mr Right may not always be Mr Right. 

Whatever tech stack a team decides to go with, just know what you're looking for - or expecting - going in.
