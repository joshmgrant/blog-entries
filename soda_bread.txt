One of my favourite recipes to make is Irish soda bread. It's one of the only baking recipes I know fairly well. The ingredients are simple enough: flour, buttermilk, oats, baking soda, salt and occasionally some caraway seeds. 

Not only is delicious, but it also has another great characteristic: it's a forgiving recipe. 

Sometimes I don't have buttermilk so I substitute milk with a bit of vinegar. I've done all whole wheat flour and all white flour based on what's in my cupboards (the recipe calls for half of each). I've doubled the amounts. I think I've even forgot the salt on occasion. I'm pretty sure I never remember the right baking temperature. 

And each time it turns out pretty good. Perhaps a bit different, but pretty good. 

There's a lot of benefits to such a recipe, not the least of which is that I /know/ I can make a loaf given a variety of circumstances. Conditions don't need to be perfect for a good loaf of bread to come out of my oven. 

Sometimes working with software can be helped by being forgiving. Allowing code to be slightly imperfect but still satisfying more important needs can be a great feature. It's often either challenging if not impossible to get things perfect in a software project. In those cases, stick to recipes that will give some flexibility.
