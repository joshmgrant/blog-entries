Here's a quick thought about project management. 

CYA, short for *Cover Your Ass* refers to the practice of managing projects or components of projects such that any blame or wrong-doing is directed *away* from you. In other words, projects that fail can't be blamed on you. While this may have short-term benefit for individuals, it generally leads to problems for teams long term. Trust is eroded and goals are distorted leading to poor team performance and missed team goals. 

CYA approaches are generally terrible, but somehow not far off from a better idea. 

Creating an environment where individuals and teams *are allowed to fail* or are aware of the possibility of not doing well is highly beneficial. Instead of turning against one another or avoiding taking risks, it encourages moving forward positively with trust.
