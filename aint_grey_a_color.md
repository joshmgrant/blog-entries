Roses are red,
Violets are blue, 
So the story goes. 
Between those two are a whole spectrum
of colours, wheeling and mixing.

Ain't I a colour? 
Some see me as a shade, as a tone.
Dull and hypothetical
Maybe even depressed.
Can't I have feelings? Expressions? 

I think so.

The bright exciting future of space.
Slient slate, natural stone, from the Earth.
Natural.
Cloudy and moody (or not).
Studious and beautiful graphite.
I can be diplomatically neutral,
and I can raw and brutal.
Shiny and strong as steel.
Beautiful and soft as silver.

Now how's that for colour?
