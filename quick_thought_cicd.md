I recently posted a [quick hot take](https://twitter.com/joshin4colours/status/930284482199879681) on Twitter about testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). The full tweet/quote was this: 

> Hot Take: the rise of CI/CD will also mean a renewed interest in exploratory and session based testing.

I just wanted to expand on that thought a little bit. 

Imagine you're a tester, and imagine you have the opportunity to sit down somewhere and open up an application to test. The application is exactly identical to how a real user or customer would find and open the app (or at least very close). You can then test this app in any way you like, and report any findings or bugs in this application any way you like. Doesn't this sound like an ideal exploratory testing setting? 

CI/CD can deliver such a setting. 

Since new features and deployments simply "roll out" from development to production, testers may explore the application in production as a user would. This is a bit of a side-effect of CI/CD, but it's one that could end up promoting good exploratory testing practices. 

I'd also like to emphasize that I'm *not* saying testers shouldn't be involved in CI/CD pipeline design (they should!) and I'm *not* saying testers shouldn't have opportunities to test pre-deployment (they should!). I'm simply saying that the rise CI/CD could result in more interest in exploratory testing. It could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
