As software companies grow, so do their engineering teams. A role that comes along with growing teams is the software engineer in test (SEIT), a software developer who primarily works with test automation and related testing infrastructure. SEITs can be extremely valuable to engineering teams as they can enable good automation practices for shipping quality code faster, and they can be a great touchpoint for test engineers and operations engineers to work with development teams. They can also be a bit tricky to hire since SEITs don't have quite the same skills as application developers or test engineers. 

Let's take a look at how your might approach hiring SEITs at different levels.

# Junior/Intern

I've worked with several interns (in Ontario called co-op students) and working with test automation is a great introduction to being a software engineer of any kind. 

## When to hire
Juniors are great on teams with established SEITs and test engineers. In some organizations there are entire teams dedicated to test automation efforts. If you need someone to bang out many test code or take partial ownership of a large test automation project, a junior hire could be a great choice.

Like in other software develoment roles, hiring a junior usually comes with an expectation that the junior candidate will receive some menitorship and early career training and experience.

## What to look for
Candidates for a junior SEIT should show characteristics of a junior test engineer and/or application developer. On the testing side, an ideal candidate should show curiosity about software or systems, the ability to develop at least basic mental models of how a piece of software might work, and good communication skills, written or oral. On the development side, an ideal candidate should show at least a basic aptitude for programming from school or otherwise. They should be able to read, write and understand code in some programming language even a language that your organization doesn't use. Previous experience working in software development is _nice_ but not a requirement.

## Key questions to ask
- "How would you test a pen?": a classic test engineering question to access a candidate's reasoning skills, communication skills and question asking ability.
- "Write a function to reverse a string in a given language": a basic but straightforward assessment of programming skills. The language can be set by the interviewer or chosen by the candidate.
- "What is something you achieved that you are proud of?": a question to get some insight into the candidate's motivations and interests.

# Intermediate
Teams getting started with test automation or parts of test automation could benefit from hiring experienced SEITs. Experienced SEITs can not just write test code but also set up needed infrastructure and coordinate with developers, operation engineers, and testers. Intermediate SEITs may also be able to start test automation efforts for new projects as needed.

## Key questions to ask

- "Write three automated tests in a given language to test this class":
- "Here is an example login test. How would you improve it?"
- "Suppose a software bug is found using test code that you wrote. What would be your first reaction?"
- "Describe a time that you and a team mate - could be an app developer, tester or SEIT - disagreed. How did you resolve your differences?"
- "What's your favourite continuous integration tool and why"
