Here's a thought experiment: 

Imagine you find a new, fancy word processor app. It's like Google Docs or Microsoft Word, but also has some impressive new features. Perhaps this word processor makes use of AI to smartly insert or complete phrases as you write. Maybe it has seamless integration with calendering for scheduling or setting deadlines. Maybe it actually makes your coffee while you write a long piece. Whatever features you can dream up, suppose it has them. You start to use it and this word processor is _actually_ impressive. 

Now imagine after a little bit of writing you notice a bunch of misspellings and typos are appearing, more and more often. After a beat, you determine this word processor doesn't have spell checking. Even after clicking around and maybe even reding the documentation, you find that it is actually the case this word processor doesn't have spellcheck in any form.

Would you continue to use this word processor? Or make it your preferred tool over whatever you use currently? 

In my opinion, I would consider using it but with some hesitation. I certainly wouldn't be giving up my Markdown editor or Google Docs. It could be a great fit often, but not all the time. 

Now let's say you decided to look into this spellchecker issue. Perhaps you reach out to the folks making this wonder word processor or read up on release notes. And imagine that other people too have noticed ths lack of spellcheck and have reached out/complained to the project owners. Certainly this feature is somewhere close on the horizon? 

What if the folks running this project say, with certainty, they have no plans to add spellchecking and consider the matter closed? Would you use this wonderful new word processor with this added information?

At this point, in my estimation, I would not use this word processor, at least not all the time. As a go-to tool for writing or creating documents, not having spellchecking in the year 2021 is a red flag for me.

So, what's the point of this thought experiment? 

When it comes to software quality, sometimes little things do really matter. In fact, "little" things aren't always so little. One piece of functionality may make the difference between a wildly loved product and one that will be lost to the sands of time. One hypothetical example is the above word processor. Even with all kinds of innovation going into a new word processor, users may still expect the boring, obvious features we've come to expect. Having the bare minimum functionality to meet users' expectations while also shipping something new is something I'll call _the spellcheck principle_. Don't ship a minimum viable product that isn't even minimal.

While these ideas have been percolating in my head for a while now, Aaron Reynolds's short discussion of [Hey's product woes](https://twitter.com/aaronreynolds/status/1423721063524020225?s=20) finally solidified things. Hey, a now defunct email collaboration tool created by the (in)famous company Basecamp, seemed to be the next iteration of great email tools. However, Aaron points out that it lacked basic email functionality such as consistent marking of read/unread messages. Of course releasing Hey without these features fully baked may have been a pragmatic decision Basecamp's part based on whatever trade-offs they were facing. However, to paraphrase Aaron, this is [email we're talking about](https://twitter.com/aaronreynolds/status/1423725049261998092?s=20): these things _should just work_.

Software development as a discipline is still relatively young and so there's lots to learn in terms of overall user experience and design. In some cases software allows people to do totally novel and interesting things while in others, it simply makes tasks that existed previously a bit easier and less painful. Designing for these scenarios isn't always straightforward but it would greatly help to keep the end user in mind.
