Need to solve a problem on a strict timeline? Here's how to do it with one weird trick. Thought leaders hate it. 

Here's one way I've been completing tasks lately: 

1. Get as _specific_ as possible a description of what needs to get done
1. Ask for a _specific time_ it needs to get accomplished by
1. Accomplish the task without asking for any additional information

The key points are specificity and the last point of not asking for any more questions. It may seem trivial but it's actually been really key for me to get stuff done. 

For me, when I ask for more information or details I try to start problem solving. If I had more information I could plan things out better. I could make suggestions or try to do things more efficiently. I'm a smart person, I can problem solve really well! This line of thinking can be more of a bug than a feature. Trying to optimize can actually complicate the matter. Often it's better to simply execute what's in front of you even if the specifics are a bit inefficient. This is particularly helpful for small tasks that "just need to get done" which are often at least as important as big tasks, if not more so.

Sometimes being a proficient problem solver needs a bit of short-circuiting to really get stuff done.
