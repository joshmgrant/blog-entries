I've been thinking of this for the past little while. It's a thought experiment that explains a lot of how the Internet works culturally. 

Suppose that I agree to have all my Internet usage tracked for some period of time (say a month). All sites I visit on all browsers and devices are recorded, along with a map of clicks, searches and URL visits to show how I arrived at each site. On top of that, context is provided for all visits: where I was when I visited some site (work, home, somewhere else), who I was with, what I was doing, even mood at the time. All kinds of metrics are recorded: site visit duration, frequency, whether I used saved credentials or not, whether I deleted cookies or bookmarked the page. Everything someone could think of.

Now let's say this data was given to another party to analyze. After looking at common sites and visits (checking email at beginning of the work day, looking at banking pages after paying bills) and some less common but explainable visits, suppose there were some unusual activities. No clear pattern. Now suppose this observer, armed with lots of contextual information, gives me a list of the most "unusual" sites and asked me why I visited them. They may even get to explain their additional findings to illustrate why these visits were unusual. 

My guess is that for the majority of those sites, I'd have no good explaination for why I visited those sites. _None_. The list may include sites with topics I don't like or am interested in, even sites I find offensive or of poor quality.

I feel like the same could be said if someone did a similar experiment with only links that I click, ads that I click or interact with or articles that I read. And I feel like the list of unusual sites would be relatively long, maybe even longer than the "typical" sites I visit or have some clear reason for visiting.

I also conject that this applies to the majority of Internet users, and does not show any scaling with Internet usage. In other words, whether someone visits many sites or few sites or is online often or rarely, the results would be the same.

I feel like a lot of long time Internet users intuitively understand this idea (eg falling down a Wikipedia rabit hole of topics). I wonder if this will be a helpful property of the Internet over time.
