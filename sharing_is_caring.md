I should give more shout outs to good people doing great test automation and tooling work out in the world. What better time to start than today?

If you're interested in browser automation take a look at what Chris McMahon [has been writing about lately](http://chrismcmahonsblog.blogspot.ca/). Recent posts discuss Test Automation Heuristics that are well written and based on good practices from years in the field.

Someone you know about in the test automation world is [Angie Jones](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908). She's an automation engineer at Twitter who is prolific with her speaking engagements. Definitely seek her out to see what good test automation looks like!

Lastly, if you're new to browser automation and happen to use Ruby or potentially could use Ruby, check out [Watir](www.watir.com). This is a great project with a wonderful community that can help with your browser automation needs big and small (as I've [written about before](http://simplythetest.tumblr.com/post/166573913200/the-third-way)).
