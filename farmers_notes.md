Notes from Farmers Q&A

## Sauce Connect
  - VPN issue: try running sc locally without VPN?
  - Overall performance issues: seeing problems with test run length
  - Smoke test performance issues: 12 min locally vs 19 minutes (benchmark is 15 min)
  - Timeout values or settings? 
- App and latency issues
  - Unexpected load testing
  - Move things close to where they need to be (sc close to app, test execution nodes close to Sauce data centre)
  - How can we get more VMs overall/per department? 
  - SC tunnels and Jenkins issue (solvable)
  - Slow emu/sim issues. What is the deal? Is the app slow or is the enviroment slow?

## Debugging on Sauce Labs
  - Idle timeout on Sauce Labs for manual debugging
