You've definitely nailed some great points in my sloppy thinking. 

First of all, yes, I do mean "checks" instead of "tests" here. I recall you tweeted a while ago something along the lines of acceptance tests are really rejection checks. I agree that I'm really talking about checks here.

As well, you're completely correct that some random, generically named person telling you something about himself is not the same as having hard proof of that trait. Of course, saying you're a chartered accountant and providing your accounting degree, CPAO certification papers, and list of past employers are two different things. It also matters if I provide this info to, say, a random person on the streets of Toronto versus a registered CPA responsible for setting some of the accounting tests themselves. 

Part of what makes tests like I describe beneficial is having confidence in their meaning and value. I glossed over this part for the sake of brevity, but it's an important point.
