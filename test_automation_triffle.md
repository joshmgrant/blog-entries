As a test automation professional and a foodie living in an [excellent food city](https://www.sureshdoss.com/foodtours), it was only a matter of time before I write about some kind of test pyramind food metaphor.

We've seen the [test automation pyramid](https://simpleedrivers-cloudi.blogspot.com/2020/01/agile-testing-by-lisa-crispin-and-janet.html), and its cousins the [test automation cupcake](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/introducing-software-testing-cupcake-anti-pattern) and [test automation ice cream cone](https://k-hartanto.medium.com/testing-pyramid-and-testing-ice-cream-cone-what-is-the-difference-6ddde3876c20#:~:text=Ice%20Cream%20Cone%20Tests%20happen%20if%20the%20pyramid,cones%2C%20the%20majority%20of%20testing%20is%20done%20manually). Let us consider the test automation triffle.

[Triffle](https://therecipecritic.com/english-trifle/) is a dessert common in the British Isles. It's a layered dessert that is both pudding-like and cake-like, depending on the composition. Generally it contains an egg custard, some kind of fruit (preserved or fresh) and a sponge or cake layer. I've seen several variations, I'm happy to report. 

The key to a good triffle is to have *enough* of the *best* layers. If you like custard, put an extra layer of that on there. If you're more of a sponge fan or want something lighter, add extra layers of those and don't add so much sweet or heavy elements. Brandy is a popular ingredient but far from required. And so on. 

This is kind of like test automation. The best developers I've known have all said some variation of "labels and test types don't matter too much, just test the thing you need to test". The notions of unit, integration, end-to-end, API, service, and so on, aren't as important as testing the essential important part. If you're a web developer, that's going to look different from an embedded systems developer, which will look different from a Python-stack towards something solely on the JVM. You want to test the critical layers, whatever they are for what you're looking at.

A bit like triffle. 

team goals
- Charles, others, to understand better
- Goal of ramping up community and getting users
- Good news! Charles was given numbers, and we agreed that a dedicated forum is not needed for now
- Excellent! Love this: slack, fuzzing weekly newsletter, yt followers, twitter followers
- _SHOW_ leveraging existing channels to engage with communities
- Aw, I'm doing a good job on videos and content
- Juliana's idea was solid
- Marion's idea: sell the stuff we're already doing, get bigger
- Call it Weekly Community Office Hour (love this journey)
- LI, Twitter, YT, whatever
- Getting started, first steps, simple examples,invite speakers, etc etc
- Link and subscribe
- Try it out!
- Week ahead of time is not a lot of time
- Published on Meetup! Virtual meetup?? Huh, this marion is a genious

Two more initatives:
1. Email campaign/onboarding emails
- Support Growth, speaking the right language. 
- Common Room???
2. Assigned a task (Marion) to find a plan for "leads" / product-led opps
- talk to a devrel
- Joshie at Applitools lmao
- Tones! Set expectations! Josh isn't sales
- Some pressure to roll this out
- Get to the bottom of this
- How do we engage with existing community

Two weeks:
- Ramping up weekly demo thing (invite people!)
- Product-led opportunities growth management (lmao)
- Onboarding emails (opt-in)

New Hire! 

The test automation pyramid is a very helpful construct, trust me. It's a good guideline to think of testing *generically*. But you can always adjust to get the best bits.
