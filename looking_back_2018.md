This year, I'm taking a look back at 2018. For me personally, this was a fabulous year with a bunch of personal and career growth. I think it's clear that for many, many other people in the world, this was far from the case. 

General
- Mental health is health, and like other health care issues, making positive changes that truly improve your life sometimes take time and a bit of encouragement
- Children are a blessing. They're also a tonne of work.
- Emotional labour is labour
- I still have faith in the #MeToo movement to bring forward some real, positive change
- I really wish that those in the news media industry would simply just give up on tablet-based or platform-specific products and let us read the news the way we want to

Software Development
- Like other areas of software development, user experience will be key in the growth (or not) of test tooling
- The Java world is a *big* world
- As an experienced developer, I still find the NodeJS world pretty frustrating sometimes
- Healthy communities around OSS *really friggin' matter*
- One of the good things about Continuous Delivery is that I think it'll be harder to ruin compared to Agile. This is a good thing.
- "Traditional" software testing is much more threatened by the concept of design thinking in managing teams than AI or automation
- "Modern" software testers are in a pretty good position for career growth, actually
- I still don't really "get" cryptocurrencies or blockchain tech
- Getting proficient with Emacs has been one of my favourite parts of 2018

Career
- Working 100% remote has been mostly a success for me
- Customer facing jobs in software are nothing like engineering jobs in software
- It's true that people don't quit jobs, they quit managers
- A shocking amount of discourse around workplace life is US-oriented, which doesn't always apply outside the US
- If nothing else, be kind to people

Food and Drink
- Owning and using a vegetable cleaver to hack up large vegetables like cabbage or squash is surprisingly good self-care
- When prepared well, chicken thighs are much better than chicken breast
- The idea of removing tipping in North American restaurants and raising prices (and in turn wages) is an intriguing one

Canadiana
- I still can't believe Doug Ford became the PC leader. I can believe the PCs won a majority with him as PC leader.
- The fact there's such a thing as inter-provincial trade restrictions is somewhat ridiculous
- I wish it was easier for Canadians to get around Canada
- Similarly, Americans are more cosmopolitan within the US than Canadians are in Canada. I think Canadians should note this.
- Cannabis is legal now and we're not all stoned all the time so I guess that's that then
