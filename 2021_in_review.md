Here are some general thoughts and observations on 2021.

## Software Testing

- I've spend a fair bit of time this year thinking about "low-code" approaches, and really the best summary I can think of is that low-code tools still probably need some code in there, somewhere.
- The future looks bright for JavaScript. But I truly have no idea which JS test tool will "win" in the long run. 
- Mobile testing is _hard_.
- Mobile test automation is _very hard_.
- There are a lot of smart people in the exploratory testing world, and they're often not loud and obnoxious.

## General Software Development

- It looks like software development is an offshoot of other human endeavour.
- I agree with everyone who says "Best Practices is a decent idea but a terrible phrase". I've tried using "Good Practices" instead but really, the ship has sailed. Trying to use a different but more suitable phrase is a big uphill battle.
- A shocking amount of software development advice online basically amounts to "Have you tried being less poor?", as in "Have you tried just getting more headcount/resources?"
- One way a developer can truly level up their skills is to join a customer-facing or sales team. You will learn so much by seeing how software is _sold_.
- Much like how Python [made programming on PCs fun again](https://xkcd.com/353/) I think projects like PyWebIO and Anvil might make web development in Python fun (again?).
- Simple rule for determining if you're in an engineering or sales org: if you definitely know when your company's year end is, you're in sales. If you have no idea what this means, you're in engineering.

## Parenting

- There is nothing better than finding out your young children are decent people, as confirmed by other people they interact with regularly.
- COVID has been pure hell on working parents and working mothers in particular. Some damage will take quite some time to heal.
- Making things accessible to those with a disability also makes things accessible to folks who don't have a disability or temporarily have a disability. We need more things that are accessible to everyone.
- People really need to shut up with "video games harm children". You're spouting nonsense.
- You really can't go wrong when you make cookies. Just make sure they're not burnt and you're all set.

## Canadiana

- Looks like Canada is, in fact, a product of the colonial experiment. And that experiment is not going so well.
- As vague as it is, Canadian culture really is a bit different from American culture. Similar sure, but there's some differences.
- Canada, as a society, is responsible for Indigenous genocide. We need to own up to that.

## Miscellaneous

- Using a vegetable cleaver to literally cleave large fruits and vegetables in half is excellent self-care.
- This year I watched the [Morning Show series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series)#Cast_and_characters). I can't stop thinking about Chip, The Morning Show's executive producer. Chip is incredibly busy over the course of a very long workday. Most of his interactions with other employees on the Morning Show are fast and Chip clearly doesn't take much time to reflect on the request. It's all go-go-go. I feel like this lack of slack is ultimately part of the undoing that happens in the show, and that simply being too busy to think does have consequences.
- Legalizing cannabis is a good idea, and that's all I have to say about that.
