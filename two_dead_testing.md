Here are two kinds of testing that are either dead or on their way to dead: 
* Basic Black Box Only Testing
* Narcissistic Assoholic Testing

If you practice one of these forms of testing, you're likely going to be out of work soon and possibly sooner than you think. 

## Basic Black Box Only Testing (BBBO)

This form of testing posits that a tester can only ever test an application as a black box that via human-only means. This form also implicitly assumes that a tester's role is only ever to test an application directly and does not include exploring team dynamics, organizational processes, codebases, application documentation or tooling. A tester practicing BBBO testing is only concerned with obtaining an application instance, looking for bugs, reporting bugs, then going home. Finding and removing underlying causes of bugs are not a priority in this method of testing. This is the responsibility of developers. Or maybe management. Someone else.

This approach to testing also means that skills such as programming, automation, tooling, process hacking or managing expectations and/or people are not overly important. Finding and reporting bugs are the two key skills required for BBBO testing - indeed, they're the only two skills required for such testing. 

## Narcissistic Assoholic Testing (NAT)

This form of testing posits that a tester not only explores applications and reports issues but is also _solely_ and morally responsible for _all_ aspects of quality related to the application under test. With this responsibility comes an overarching authority to do whatever it takes for an application to match a tester's perceptions of authority. This authority supercedes any other team member's authority, regardless of any formal or informal agreements, and in some cases supercedes end user and customer authority. In this case, this form of testing suggests that a tester can do essentially anything to allow or prevent certain features of an application into production. This may include

* Bullying other team members to do what's asked - even to the detriment of the project
* Verbal and written harassment in aid of testing goals
* Smearing or tearing down opposing approaches or ideas
* Removing team members who do not adhere to such approaches regardless of their value and commitment to the project.

A tester employing NAT approaches may describe such approaches as "tough love" or "the ends justifying the means". NAT is designed to work regardless of team, software context, product or even whether the project is a success. Usually, testers employing NAT appear themselves to be narcissistic assholes.

Both of these approaches result in low-value test efforts. Testers using such approaches will probably have difficulty finding work. Put differently, they mind experience that their flavour of testing is dead.
