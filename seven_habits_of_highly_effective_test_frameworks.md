From JUnit to Jest, RSpec to [FRUIT](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fortranxunit/), there is a plethora of test frameworks out there for test automation.*

Of course it takes all sorts in the candy bowl of life, and the same is true for test frameworks. Here are six habits that good test frameworks follow:

1. Provide a user-friendly command line interface
2. Allow for running one, several or all tests
3. Provide capability for skipping or disabling tests (and actually do it)
4. Allow for running tests in parallel, for better or worse
5. Output parsable, complete results
6. Being agnostic to the "what" and "how" tests are testing

While it's not 
<!--
1. Your test framework will only ever be used for unit testing
2. Ok, unit testing and maybe API testing
3. Ok, unit, API, service, database and (G)UI testing, but definitely only on desktop web applications
4. Your test framework only needs to run tests in order.
5. Maybe running tests concurrently.
6. Ok, running tests in arbitrary order and in parallel
7. Running a single test
