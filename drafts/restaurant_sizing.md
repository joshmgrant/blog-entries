A while back I wrote about [how to size up your test automation project](). The overall idea was that test automation projects can have different characteristics according to their size, and in turn should be approached differently. I still really like this idea. Test automation projects (browser testing or otherwise) are software projects in their own right and should be treated as such. As well, test automation projects often interface with other aspects of software development and co-evolve with these aspects. 

As a sort of hardening exercise (harding sprint, if you will), I'm going to paraphrase the ideas of test automation project sizing in terms of restaurants. This might help clarify some rough edges of this idea.

1. Minimal
1. Small
1. Medium
1. Enterprise

Since the sandwich is only for you,you can choose any style you like. Based on the ingredients available, you could make a peanut butter and jam on bread or ham and cheese on a roll.

## Small

You are making lunch for a few friends. You have all discussed when to meet ahead of time and you know who is coming. You decide to make sandwiches for the group since you know everyone likes them. However, Alice has a
