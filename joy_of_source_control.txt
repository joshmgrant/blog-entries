Like Rodney Dangerfield, I feel like source control gets no respect. 
 
Good source control systems (Git, Subversion, Mercurial and so on) are widely used in software development. These systems are generally used, as the name implies, to keep track of changes made to the source by different team members. That allows developers to see the progress of new changes and potentially roll back bad changes to avoid problems. 

Developers widely understand source control as this and only this. It is a tool but a simple, limited one. Some feel that source control can get in the way of producing good code by breaking the "flow".  Others feel that source control is something only professional developers on professional projects need to use.

Modern source control can do so, /so/ much more than that.

I've been working with Git for about a year now, and I think it's an excellent tool for any developer. In fact, I'd say it's an excellent tool for anyone working with text of any sort. Source control can do handy things if you learn how to use it. Source control systems don't just save your work; they make make it easier and more efficient to produce good code. For some reason, some programmers just don't feel this way. I'm going to give some examples of what source control like Git can do for you. 

Conduct small, one-off experiments: Sometimes looking at code, you might want to try out something small. Maybe it's not even directly relevant to what you're working on or just a nagging question about the language you're working with. What happens if I make x a float instead of an int? What if I delete this line of code? What does that constructor actually do? With good source control, you can easily undertake these experiments. Just make the change, figure out whatever you want to know, and repeat. Once you're done, you may end up with something irrelevant to your work. You'll avoid losing your place while coding or introducing annoying errors with superfluous code.  

Conduct large, complex experiments: Suppose you want to re-write a large chunk of code but are not sure how it will turn out. Or you want to start a "test-first" approach to writing code for an existing project. These experiments could take days or weeks, affecting significant parts of your code base. How do you do this while not breaking current work? Again, there are good approaches to doing this. Workflows like *feature branching* [http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html] allows parallel development between the mainline of a project and an experimental subproject. Feature branches can also be used to share such experiments among team members for commenting or additional work, again without disrupting the mainline of development. 

Portability: This one seems basic but can be quite helpful. Having a repository in a central location makes getting source code a breeze. Setting up a machine for a new developer? How about working with your code on an arbitrary test machine? Getting code is as easy as a pull command. 

Basic Continuous Integration: CI is all the rage these days, for good reason. CI helps developers and teams build and release products faster and with higher confidence. But instead of diving into some hardcore CI setup, some source control systems have similar functionality in a slightly stripped down form. In Git and Subversion, you can add hooks to perform particular actions like post-committing or pre-pushing. For example, you could put your commit messages through a formatter or trigger automated tests. Hooks can be as simple or involved as you want, making a good firs step toward a larger scale CI system. 

Personal Projects: With distributed source control systems like Git or Mercurial, you don't need to connect to a server at all. You can set up a new repo in a single command. Because of this, you can use "professional" source control for your personal projects, no matter how small. You'll have all of the above benefits even when you're hacking around in your free time. 

There are more benefits, obviously, to using source control well, but these are the ones that I've seen in practice. Honestly, the first two points alone are worth the price of admission in my opinion. 

Don't just passively push and pull your changes. Give your source control system the respect is deserves.
