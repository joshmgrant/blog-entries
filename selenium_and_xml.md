Could Selenium be the next XML? 

I mean this in the most positive, ambitious way. 

I recently found and article on [the continuing success of XML](https://www.w3.org/blog/2018/07/the-world-wide-success-that-is-xml/). This article mentions that XML is now a W3C standard and that work standardizing XML and various related projects is complete. It's a good article even if it's discussing a topic that's perhaps not always interesting. The article also notes how widely used XML is as a data interchange format. Often, most people in technology don't directly work with XML but instead work with interfaces and tools that use XML. It has become a part of background infrastructure, like the wires and boxes behind the lights in a house.

As the Selenium project becomes closer to a [W3C standard](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2018/may/31/seleniumW3C/), I thought to myself what the future of the Selenium project and the WebDriver could look like. One possible future is like that of XML, where the WebDriver becomes a part of infrastructure that is (mostly) used through interfaces and tools instead of used directly. There are already several organizations and tools that leverage components of the Selenium project, so this could be not just a possibility but a good possibility. The WebDriver has been architected well in order to be extendable. 

As the Selenium project grows and evolves, it's important to take a look at the big picture and see how Selenium might look in the future beyond how it's used today.
