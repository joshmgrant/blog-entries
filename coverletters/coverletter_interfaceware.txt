To Interfaceware Inc., 

With a background in technical problem solving and as an individual with a collected but confident personality, I would like to apply for the position of C++ Developer with Interfaceware. My particular blend of talents, from mathematical aptitude to a fast, flexible learner and team member, make me a strong candidate for this position. I feel I would be an asset in this position to your coding team. 

Recently completing my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics has given me a flavour of solving scientific and technical challenges. It also provided me with experience in approaching problems from multiple angles. After these positive experiences, I wanted to find a career in the non-academic world that has similar creative opportunities in technical problem solving. I am currently employed with a small biotechnology company that undertakes scientific research and commercial development in 3D brain imaging. Being in this environment has shown me several aspects of how a technology-based company operates. It also has sparked my interest in software development in professional settings. 

In the past, I have undertaken projects in scientific coding such as Monte Carlo simulation and statistical programming, mostly in C/C++, Perl and Matlab. I feel I would be a good fit for working with your team on these projects by bringing many talents to the table. Not only am I a motivated individual with a strong sense of initiative, but I also have the programming skills and aptitude to learn new languages and protocols. 

Included with this cover letter is my resume for your perusal. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely, 


Joshua Grant
