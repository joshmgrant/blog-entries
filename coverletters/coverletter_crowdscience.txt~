As a Master's in applied mathematics entering the software development arena, I feel I'm an excellent candidate for the Junior Software Engineer position as seen on craigslist. My combination of analytical and logical thinking skills, programming aptitude and strong social skills make me a prime candidate for this position. 

In terms of programming abilities, my experience is mostly in scientific and numerical computing. Mainly, this has corresponded to coding in C++ and Matlab. As an example of this, I designed, wrote and debugged a Monte Carlo simulation of population dynamics on a bipartite network as part of my Master's degree. This project took over a year and a half, and gave me a great chance to develop my coding skills. On the web developing side, I have some experience with Perl/CGI, as I have developed a database of corporate ownership based on SEC filings. This database had a web interface, in which I used my (requisite) HTML skills. The main reasons I used Perl for this project was 1) it is a great scripting language, 2) the regular expression capabilities of Perl were well suited for the text-basd problems I faced and 3) I wasn't aware of Python's existence. More recently, I have been working with Python on my own, which is an excellent high level scripting/all purpose language. I feel I would be particularly efficient with the NumPy/SciPy modules based on my proficiency with Matlab.

In addition to my hard skills, I also have a great work ethic and sense of humour. I can work in either team or individual settings, and I can work with a variety of (read: not necessarily nice) personalities. Software development is a career path I believe I'm best suited to, and would be a terrific addition to your team. 

Included with this email is my resume in PDF format for your perusal. Thanks for this opportunity and I look forward to hearing from you.
