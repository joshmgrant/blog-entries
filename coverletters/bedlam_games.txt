As a mathematics graduate turning software developer, I would like to apply for the position of Junior Software Developer. My mix of mathematical skills and knowledge, strong analytical and problem solving skills and work hard, play hard work ethic make me an excellent candidate for this position. 

In terms of hard skills, I've had experience in software development in both academic and industrial settings. I have experience with programming in C/C++, Perl, Python and Visual Basic, in both Windows and Linux environments. The prime example of my development abilities is the Monte Carlo simulation I designed, programmed and debugged for my Master's degree. This was a C/C++ program that included psuedorandom number generation and developing objects to represent graph-theoretic network structures. I also have some exposure to OpenGL and Boost for C++ in my current role in a small biotechnology start-up company. Complementing and strengthening my software development skills is my mathematical background, particularly in linear algebra and numerical methods. Linear algebra is particular passion of mine, one which could translate well to 2D and 3D game programming. 

In addition to my mathletic skills, I'm also a quick learner. Working in a dynamic start-up environment, I am comfortable and proficient with keeping to tight deadlines and multitasking. I can work effectively in either a team or individual setting, and can work with a variety of personalities good, bad and ugly. My favourite games include the Grand Theft Auto series (particularly Vice City) and Blades of Steel for NES. 

Included with this email is my resume in PDF format for your consideration, as well as some sample code I've written for a Monte Carlo simulation in C/C++ and some network structure object definitions in Python. I thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to hearing from you.
