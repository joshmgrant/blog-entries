I haven't been blogging much lately due to life circumstances, so here's some year-end thoughts, categorized for your convenience. (hat tip to Paul Ford for his [Questions, 2016 post](https://medium.com/@ftrain/all-my-dumb-questions-december-2016-b6b4ee84284c#.frgyox6k0) for inspiration)

**Software Development**
- Continuous Delivery will go more and more mainstream - if piecemeal - in the coming year
- Continuous integration services are awesome and everyone should know this.
- Good tooling and a strong ecosystem around a programming language makes all the difference.
- Desktop development has reached this nifty point in evolution where going from zero to working application is fast enough for regular folks to get into it.
- VS Code is probably my favourite text editor that I've used. Microsoft is making fun developer stuff again!
- Adtech is tech. And advertisting. And people should really acknowledge and understand this.

**Software Testing**
- Being solely a "black box" functional tester really isn't a viable career path these days. Testers need to branch out or change career paths eventually.
- A lot of testers have been soured on the idea of automation and tooling and that's really too bad.
- The ideas coming out of "combined engineering" and Extreme Programming (XP) methodologies are pretty cool and testers should really take note of them.

**Canadiana**
- Calling Alberta "the Texas of Canada" isn't entirely an insult and could even be a compliment.
- If Alberta is the Texas of Canada then Edmonton could be Canada's Austin.
- One thing Ontario could to to helps its economy with a good ROI is modernize its liquor laws.
- A lot of Twentieth Century Canadian art, film and literature were kind of a bummer. Why is this? Was it a bummer time in Canadian culture, or something else?
- There's a good case to be made that contrary to what a lot of Torontonians believe Toronto has the best climate of any large Canadian city.

**Writing**
- The genre of "$ListOfItems: Ranked" listicles/articles was a good one but seemed to come and go quickly. What happened?
- Some of the most insightful pieces of writing I've seen this year have been in the form of tweetstorms.
- One thing I like about writing as a hobby is that it doesn't really take up much physical space. As time goes on this is a bigger and bigger plus for me.

**Life Lessons**
- What I thought would be difficult about parenting six months before my son was born and what I think is difficult about parenting eighteen months after my son was born are vastly different
- 2016 was honestly a bad year in general, but there are good years and bad years
