To channel Hardy's _Apology of a Mathematician_, it is lamentable when a writer writes about writing. Here, I'm making an exception since I've been reflecting on communication in general. 

I think of myself as a decent writer--solid top quartile in terms of quality. For me, writing has been a form of communication for other ideas. Of course there are other ways of communicating ideas, such as mathematics and visual art. I've never really thought about my writing as art, even if it may be in a very strict sense. I've always enjoyed technical writing since, to me at least, that form of writing is about communicating ideas well and providing something of value to reader. There's more to writing than simply transmitting of information. 

Two people who I deeply admire for their communication through writing are Ta-Nehasi Coates and Tressie McMillian Cottom. I think contrasting their work provide one distinction between communication in terms of quality: being able to _write_ well versus being able to _think_ well. Coates is an excellent writer, providing an exemplar for how to communicate beautifully with words. Cottom is an excellent thinker, providing work that shows deep thinking and consideration of ideas and how to communicate those well through words.

I consider these two writers since in many ways their work is comparable from a purely literary perspective; both are published authors, both are contemporary Black Americans, and both write about social issues from a personal perspective (broadly speaking). Strictly speaking, in terms of content and format, I think these two writers are suitable for comparison. The distinction I want to draw is in their styles: Ta-Nehasi can _really write_ and Tressie can _really think_. 

## Coates as Storyteller Wordsmith

The first piece of writing I encountered from Coates was his article _Acting French_. 

## Cottom as Profound Thinker

Cottom appeared to me from Twitter, where she was a rising star of social media. Following her tweets for some time, I eventually read some of her essays, coming to read her second book _Thick_.
