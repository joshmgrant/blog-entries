The other day I was delighted to find out that the cult classic film [Super Troopers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247745/) is now available for free on some streaming service in my locale. A facet of modern life is suddenly finding films or television programs free and ready on streaming services, and this was one of those little bits of digital content joy for me. 

I will say upfront that Super Troops is an American farcical comedy that is far from unproblematic. Plus, potty humour is itself an acquired taste. I will set aside these aspects of the film for this post but yes, it's a dumb movie with stupid stuff. 

The plot of the film is as one may expect from the [Broken Lizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Lizard) oeuvre: a highway patrol unit in Vermont is composed of several lovable losers who goof around in between traffic stops. Tensions rise with the local and markedly unlovable police force when the local senator (or was it the local congressman?) announces that one of the law enforcement divisions will need to close due to budget cuts, whilst a deadly drug ring places all the officers on high alert to bust the criminals. All the while, our trusty highway patrol are on the case and chugging whole bottles of maple syrup since we are, in fact, in Vermont.

(It turns out that the most unrealistic aspect of this movie is that law enforcement agencies may actually face significant resource cuts, but 2001 was a simpler time.)

Yes, this movie is silly but one aspect of the film really struck me. When the captain of the highway patrol starts hinting that the closure of the highway patrol becomes more of a "when" than an "if" situation, the officers turn more sombre. Not sombre for losing their paying jobs, but more for losing their beloved if malaligned institution and colleagues. In fact, discussions of moving out of town or picking up other work happen almost instantly and without any resentment. The real feeling is losing their _current_ team. Nothing related to financial difficulties, housing arrangements or even rethinking big picture career goals, simply sadness that they can't [play the cat game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rlSjdnAKY4) on the job anymore.

In essence, the disappointment is the loss of mediocrity, the feeling that whatever day job comes next will possibly suck just a tiny bit more.

Currently, we're living through an American recession and the largest tech layoffs in a generation. People are losing their jobs for reasons almost unrelated to their actual work performance, and wading into temporary uncertainty. Even before that, the job market seems to have unending volatility.
