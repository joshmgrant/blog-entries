"Submit a pull request. Patches welcome!"

If you've worked even a little bit with open-source software (OSS), you've likely seen this phrase said by a project maintainer or contributor. This has become even more prevalent during the rise of Git as a popular version control system and GitHub along with it. It may seem a like almost a throwaway line, but I think there's more to it than that. Pull requests aren't just (a way to update a codebase)[https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/]; they're also a medium for communication within the community that is built around that codebase. How pull requests are handled give an indication of how a community works overall.

One meaning of "Submit a pull request" is a genuine request of "Help improve our code!". OSS projects heavily depend on the goodwill of individual contributors to make things better. When projects encourage individuals to contribute, it can be a benefit for everyone. Projects grow, communities grow with them and almost as a side benefit, useful software appears. Pull requests help enable this, and there are even people working to help individuals (make first-time pull requests to projects)[https://twitter.com/yourfirstpr] that are looking for contributors. In this sense, "Submit a pull request" is a message of reaching out to the wider world with good intentions. 

Another meaning of "Submit a pull request" has the opposite intention: "If you don't like this, shut up and fix it yourself". The meaning in this case is to - at least implicitly - close down conversation. This may happen in an OSS that's hostile to suggestions from outside or new contributors. Somewhat weirdly, some prominent OSS communities seem to endorse (acting badly towards contributors)[http://www.itworld.com/article/3000564/linux/linus-goes-on-epic-rant-about-linux-kernel-code.html]. This can be off-putting towards both new contributors and even (well-seasoned contributors)[http://sarah.thesharps.us/2015/10/05/closing-a-door/]. Flatly telling individuals to submit a pull request without support or additional information can indicate a community that isn't open to "outsiders". It may even mean that maintainers of a project aren't interested in criticism, constructive or otherwise. 

Seeing these two interpretations, a pull request really is a form of communication similar to a blog post or a tweet. Often it's not just what's said but _how_ it's said that communicates a message. It's just the same in software.
