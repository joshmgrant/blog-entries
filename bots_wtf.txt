I feel like I owe Anil Dash an apology and explanation. 

The other day on Twitter he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/anildash/status/719981401085517825) about how there's lots of prior art and good practices for making bots good citizens of the web. I made a [comment on that tweet](https://twitter.com/joshin4colours/status/719987192756596736) that saying that good practices on bots aren't much more important than getting venture capital funding for writing one. This comment was meant to be sarcastic; bots are [hot](http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/30/microsoft-bot-framework/) [right](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/13/facebook-f8-from-virtual-reality-to-bots-all-the-announcements-explained.html) [now](http://www.wired.com/2015/08/slack-overrun-bots-friendly-wonderful-bots/) for some reason, so there's probably a lot of folks in tech that are clamouring to either create one or fund creating one. Anil's advice is good and should be heeded, particularly when tech {always isn't doing too well on the moralistic front](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/microsoft-apologizes-for-creating-a-teenage-racist-homophobic-chatbot). 

I know bots are kind of old technology - from at least IRC days - and so anyone who's been around the WWW for any amount of time has probably interacted with one somehow. Anil is one person who's been around for quite sometime in the online world, so he knows what he's talking about. I didn't mean to undercut his message, it's an important one that I agree with. I'm sorry about that, Anil.
