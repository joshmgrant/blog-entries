# Josh's Blog Entries

Hello! I'm Josh Grant, and these are the contents of various blog entries I've written. There's some other stuff in here too.

## Motivation

Why did I decide to open source my blog entries? Was it to show my method for writing, or provide insight to my creative process? Not really, it was more because GitHub is convenient, really.

## Installation

There is no installation needed. Mostly these are markdown files, so render them as you see fit.

## Testing

Somewhat ironically, there are no tests for this repo.

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome I guess ¯_(ツ)_/¯
