Acceptance Testing

The last approach I'll take is Acceptance testing. This approach is used to validate that the software does what is supposed to do in basic cases. Sometimes the term [happy path testing]() is used, which is kind of what I'm doing here. 

My main approach is to follow the user interface (UI), documentation and written guidelines from the application itself.
