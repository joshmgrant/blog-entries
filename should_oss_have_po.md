Should large open source software (OSS) projects have (dedicated) [product owners](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/product-owner/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'product*20owner~'product*20ownership))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1))? 

This question came to me in a discussion an esteemed colleague at Sauce Labs. It's a thinker for sure. 

Software projects - open source or not - can get large and complex. Figuring out which features and bug fixes to prioritize and how to schedule schedules can become a job in themselves, which is traditionally where a product owner would step in. Why not in OSS projects? 

Additionally, there is a periodic topic that comes up around [project maintainer burnout](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3563326/what-does-an-open-source-maintainer-do-after-burnout.html) and perils therein. This has direct consequences: some projects are used by huge numbers of developers while only really being maintained by one or two people. Could someone dedicated to an OSS project as a product owner help out? 

Lastly, I'll point out that several [large](https://www.ansible.com/) [open](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [source](https://reactjs.org/) projects are explicitly backed by large companies, who hire and employ folks to work directly on these (usually free) OSS projects. It's plausible that a product owner might also be assigned to one of these projects on at least a part-time basis.

I can also see some counter-arguments. OSS projects should be owned by the maintainer and or the community, and placing a person in charge of "product" would go against this social contract. As well, how "big" should a project be before a product owner should step in? A product owner for a project with six users might be, well, unfulfilling for everyone involved.

Still, it's a compelling question. When maintainers aren't coding as much as reading and responding to issues, maybe they could use some help?
