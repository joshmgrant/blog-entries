Gold is a classic material used in the arts. Ceremonial, regal and projecting an element of wealth and richness, gold has been used by such artists as Agnes Martin in her piece Friendship. For many in positions of government, gold in various forms (gold leaf, flakes, painted gold and so on) provides a sense of elegance while projecting power. As such, it seems like a natural choice for the sitting President of the United States to choose gold as a centrepiece of their Oval Office.
