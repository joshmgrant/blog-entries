This week I changed a toilet set on my main floor toilet. This was a substantial achievement, and I was able to do this thanks to my extensive mathematical training.

If you've ever changed a toilet seat on a standard toilet (in North America, anyway), you'll know it is fairly straightforward: undo the screws or latches on the old seat, remove the seat from the porcelain, remove any screws or nuts, and attach the new seat. I've done this a few times in my life and it is not too difficult. 

However, this toilet seat was not easy to replace. 

It was a style installed by the previous owners of my house that did not have easy to remove latches or nuts. The hinges were chrome and only attached by thick screws that went through the porcelain and had plastic nuts that held the screws and seat in place. The nuts were fastened extra tight, and could would not budge. It took me multiple attempts with multiple wrenches, and I could still not remove even one nut.

The turning point was realizing the entire problem (remove the old seat and install the new one) depended on solving one small aspect of the problem (remove one nut from a bolt). If I could solve this one small problem, I could solve the entire larger problem. 

In mathematics sometimes a large problem can be reduced to a smaller problem or to a set of smaller problems. For example, properties of square matrices are often related, and knowing one aspect of a square matrix - for example, that it has a determinant of 4 - means you know lots about the matrix in question. With a determinant of 4 (aka not zero), we know the matrix has full rank and that it is invertible. Many problems in dynamical systems theory come down to knowing the eigenvalues of a square matrix, so even knowing what the determinant is can help provide information about the entire system. 

In my case, I knew I had to remove the plastic nut. Using a hammer and chisel I hacked off the nut, which loosened the bolt enough that I could shift and remove the second nut on the other side, and in turn, remove the old seat. I was able to reduce my larger problem into a smaller one.

This shift in thinking also had a psychological benefit. All of a sudden a difficult multi-step problem became a focused single-step one. I moved the problem forward.

Math is surprisingly helpful to learn as a way to learn problem solving and thinking, even in situations that look like you're going down the drain.
