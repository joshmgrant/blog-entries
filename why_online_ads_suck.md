No one likes online ads. Even though content presented with ads is one of (if not the) dominant business models of the Web, people hate ads. Print publications have been successful for decades using advertising as main component of their business. What gives? 

I think the short answer is: digital ads and the digital ad ecosystem - generally speaking with some notable exceptions - really suck. 

It's not because people inherently dislike marketing or advertising. I think people are generally ok with seeing ads on or with web content that's otherwise free. The problem is with the ad content itself. Ads tend to be horrible on a variety of dimensions such as user experience, security, privacy, and performance. 

Part of why this is the case is lack of inspiration. Digital advertising on websites sort of happened accidentally. THe early days of the Internet and webpages were mainly about a small community of academics and computer geeks. Eventually there came a tipping point and a lot of people were online reading webpages. Advertisers figured this out and started to experiment with ways of putting ads on webpages, including some [accidentally terrible ideas](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/3-i-didnt-mean-to-break-the-internet/). Since most advertisers have only (maybe!) started to get Internet culture now but ads have existed for quite sometime online, there's been a long gap between putting ads on the web and thinking about how ads fit in to digital culture. Ads were kind of seen as a slap-dash solution instead of a piece of a content branding pie. 

Instead of thinking of ads as something bolted on, digital ads could be better if thought about more holistically. 

As an example of this, look at Super Bowl ads. The Super Bowl is a big sporting event, watched by millions of people in the US and beyond. A staple of this event are the televised ads, which are TV ads that people _want_ to see. These ads are one of highlights of the Super Bowl for quite a number of Americans. They're so beloved that the CRTC [has allowed Canadians to view American Super Bowl ads for the 2017 Bowl](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/crtc-to-allow-u-s-super-bowl-commercials-starting-in-2017-1.2936096). These are TV ads that people are actively trying to see.

Contrast that to whatever interstitial you probably fought to close when opening a link to a news post.

Digital ads need to remember that [advertisting in content](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080318/004136567/advertising-is-content-content-is-advertising.shtml) and be a bit more appealing for readers, publishers and advertisers alike.
