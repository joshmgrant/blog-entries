I find out a former work colleague has recently had a ten year work anniversary in their current company. Is this something to celebrate? 

LinkedIn appears to think the answer is "yes". Is there a problem here? 

One class of software "bugs" I've been thinking about lately are related to social media or digital social networks. These are issues that are related to how different applications make use of features that have some kind of social component. I put "bugs" in quotation marks here because it's not always clear that these issues are negative or buggy. They're often intended as features, but I'm not sure that's a correct categorization either. There's something deeper going on. 

I'll provide two examples of what I mean here: the Twitter unfollow bug, and LinkedIn's work anniversary notifications. 

The Twitter unfollow bug seems pretty straightforward. There is a long-standing bug in Twitter where accounts that were previously followed by a given user are randomly set to unfollow. It seems there's no real reason for this, and it happens sporadically. Having an account that a user chooses to follow be set to unfollow without warning seems like a straightforward bug that should be fixed. 

However, research in how human social networks form and evolve gives an argument for how the Twitter unfollow bug is [really a feature](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-beauty-of-twitters-unfollow-bug/256839/). The argument goes like this: forgetting or losing contact with someone and then remembering this lost connection and reaching out to revive this connection is a normal and healthy part of human relationships. This is because human relationships are dynamic and evolve. Re-evaluating relationships - including forgotten ones - can build stronger social networks. In the case of Twitter, realizing one of your previous follows has been unfollowed can revive interest in them and create a stronger connection. Whether this is an annoying bug or interesting social feature could be argued either way.

The other social "bug" example is LinkedIn anniversary notifications. Again, the premise is simple: since LinkedIn is a social network app, many notifications from LinkedIn provide information from individuals within a users' social network to entice that user to click and enter the LinkedIn ecosystem. One form of notification informs
