Really the title of the post says everything. Using a specific tool is _not_ the task to complete. It is the tool. 

This comes up often in software development, where folks like to discuss and plan around a tool instead of a task, but an analogy I've been thinking about is dishwashers. 

I have a dishwasher and by far it's my favourite kitchen appliance. Dirty dishes go in, I turn it on, and a little while later, clean dishes come out. It works, it works well, and it does what I need it to do. One day, I was thinking about the role of being a dishwasher in a restaurant, which is a traditional "entry-level" role in the hospitality industry. I wondered: Why don't restaurants simply use one or more great dishwasher appliances instead of a full-time employee dishwasher? 

This thought (which wasn't too well-considered) lasted a few minutes before I realized the answer: there's more to keeping dishes clean than washing them. Dishwasher employees need to clean guest flatware and tableware for sure, but also pots and pans and such for the back-of-the-house kitchen as well. These items need to be cleaned, _and_ allocated back to where they should be, _and_ this should be done in a timely way. Cleaning a dish is only one aspect of this job. The _task_ is to keep items in a kitchen clean and ready as needed, where an automatic dishwasher appliance is a _tool_ to help accomplish this task. 

The same goes for test automation approaches, for example. Choosing Selenium over Playwright for browser testing is making a decision about a _tool_, but deciding what kinds of tests or aspects of a software development process should be automated is (likely) the _task_.

Keep this in mind when thinking about tools and tasks.
