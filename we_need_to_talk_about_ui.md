Hi there. Please take a seat. 

I think we need to talk about UI automation. 

I think you need to hear this, even if you won't like it. 

_[deep breath]_

UI automation - in web apps, in mobile apps, in desktop apps - seems like magic. You can open and manipulate your app in its native environment, _right there_! You can automate steps, automate workflows, and generally work with an application almost like a human being would. And some of the tools you can use to do this are actually _good_! 

If you're someone with decision-making powers in your company or organization, UI automation can get _more_ magical. Imagine simply _buying_ a tool to do all this automation. Just like that! It's almost too good to be true!

Well, that's because it is too good to be true. There is no magic here. UI automation won't magically fix your software problems, or even your testing and quality problems.

Aren't you glad you sat down?

The truth is, even if UI automation is a good fit for what you need, it doesn't mean there's no work to do. _Someone_ has to implement tests. _Someone_ needs to translate test cases or whatever else you have into this new approach and tooling. And you can't simply automate decision making or importing your old work into the new way of doing things. 

Of course some very smart people have [explained this quite well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5FzPgpMiqk) and I don't have to tell you that software quality is incredibly important. But I feel like I need to say something. 

There is a world of excellent tools, smart people and modern approaches to apply automation to various aspects of software development and quality assurance. It's mostly not too bad.

But it ain't magic, and there's still work to do.
