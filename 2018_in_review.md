Since it's the end of the year, here's some reflection on ideas I've had from 2018, categorized in no particular order: 

## General/Overall
- 2017 was a very bad year for a lot of people. Let's accept this, and try to make 2018 much better for everyone.
- I'm cautiously optimistic that the #MeToo movement to end widespread sexual assaults and harassment will yield some good long terms results for everyone overall and women in particular.
- Of the people I follow on Twitter, who make me go "wow, this person is way too smart for me to even comprehend", the majority of them are non-men.
- I do wonder if social is actually the best economic system but due to the assoholic nature of people the best that's possible to achieve is capitalism.
- One person being kind can make one hell of a difference.

## Software Development
- Test automation is going to continue to be *en vogue* this coming year.
- More and more test automation efforts, teams, and tooling will (correctly) focus on automation below the UI/not end-to-end automation.
- Browser automation is still a really under-appreciated area of software development. So much to learn at all kinds of levels.
- I'm completely disinterested in the blockchain and in cryptocurrencies.
- Continuous Delivery is simultaneously pretty complex and dead easy to implement as a software development methodology.
- Continuous integration services/tooling has joined source control in the "must have for anything beyond a toy project" category of software projects.
- If you're in software testing and mention some opinion similar to "I am unconvinced if testers should learn to program or take any professional interest in programming" I will stop listening to you
- I still really enjoy working with Python.
- I'm still not too excited about working with NodeJS in professional settings but could find it fun for personal/small projects.

## Work Life
- There's a great doctoral thesis in organizational behaviour waiting to be written about how blame culture scales and evolves as business organizations grow. 
- Choosing a career path is as much about fitting in culturally as it is in terms of skill set. Often times, cultural fit is much more important than skill fit. 
- Being "automated out of a job" is either terrifying or completely great depending on context.
- Being "automated out of a job" is also much more a political/managerial decision than some technological one.

## Canadiana
- I really wish employment opportunities were more equally distributed across Canada, and not limited to a few large urban centres.
- Despite the above previous statement, I love living in Toronto and love being in a large cosmopolitan city.
- Even though I didn't see it in person, I really enjoyed the [big duck](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/giant-rubber-duck-arrives-in-toronto-after-controversy/article35526362/).
- I like CANADALAND, but there's something that bugs me about it that I can't quite put my finger on.
- The best depictions of Toronto in popular culture often come from Canadian/Toronto hip hop artists.
- "Quebec is Canada's Florida" is something I heard once and I can't get that phrase out of my head now.
