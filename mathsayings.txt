Today, I had a small conversation with Tim Hopper on Twitter about using language skills picked up from math classes.

It was fun, particularly since I haven't been in a math class for quite a while. I think what made it enjoyable was the fact that, in my experience anyway, being a math student comes with a lot of social downsides. 

When I was in school and people asked me what I was studying or what my major was, the responses to "math" or "applied math" were pretty consistent. About eighty percent were along the lines of "Ugh, I hated calculus/I hated statistics", fifteen percent were "oh, that's different/we have that program here?", and the lowly five percent of "that's interesting". It's a tough row to hoe studying math. It's also not something one gets to discuss much outside of university settings. 

One other thing that math people appreciate is how mathematicians communicate. It's a formal way of communicating that's quite prevelant in math and academia but not done much elsewhere. It can be both a bit pretenious and snidely funny at times, so it kind of sticks with you after a while. 

In light of this, I propose a way for math folks to have some fun with this trait: The Math Phrase Sneaking Challenge. 

It goes like this: 
-Go to a social setting like a cocktail party
-Have math-inclined people agree to a game
-Each person tries to sneak a "math phrase" into conversation without any hiccups
-Each phrase has a given point value ("points" may be subsituted for "drinks")
-At the end of the event, whoever has the most points wins 

Without further ado, here's the phrase scoring:

One Point:        
-"Clearly, X is..."
-"Obviously, X is..."
-"It turns out that..."

Two points:
-"Henceforth, ..."
-"It is trivial to see that..."
-"It can be shown that..."
-"Probabilastically..."

Four points:
-"Suppose... then by contradiction, ..."
-"As a corollary, we find..."
-"Bifurcation"

Eight points:
-"...up to isomorphism."
-"Proceeding inductively, we find..."
-"Quo est demonstratum" 

Sixteen points:
-"...up to homeomorphism"
-"..all but finitely many points..."
-"Without loss of generality, suppose that..."

Thirty-Two points:
-"...iteratively applying the previous lemma..."
-"Assuming this process is Markovian, then..."
"...by a diagonalization argument..."   

Sixty-Four points:
-"...applying the same techniques as Wiles did, we find..."
-""
