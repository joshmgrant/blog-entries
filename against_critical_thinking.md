Being able to think critically is often seen as a basic skill in the world of knowledge work. Most people feel that critical thinking and being able to solve difficult problems is an essential skill for most work done today. 

I agree, but there is a downside to critical thinking as well. 

Consider a thought experiment: making a cup of tea.

You want to make a hot cup of tea. You have a tea bag, mug, teapot and an electric kettle filled with water in a modern kitchen. What do you? 

Likely, you'd plug in the kettle, turn it on and wait for the water to boil. After this, you'd make your tea in the tea pot. 

If this seems deceptively straightforward, then you're starting to see the point: you don't really need much critical thinking or deep problem solving skills in this situation. In fact, the process is easy and expected. Boil water, make tea. Simple right? 

Now suppose your electric kettle has a North American electrical plug and rating, but you and your kitchen are located in France. North American plugs look like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#/media/File:NEMA-AC-Power-Plugs.jpg) while French plugs look like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#/media/File:Euro-Flachstecker_2.jpg). Basically, plugging in your North American kettle to a French wall socket won't work, for a few reasons. 

Now what do you do? 

One idea is to try to rework the electrical wiring of the kettle. Perhaps you could cut off the plug from the kettle, cut off the plug from another appliance in the house and wire the two together. This would likely fail because French and North American voltages are different. You could try this, see what happens, then iterate. 

Or you could get another kettle that works in France.

The first idea in this "American kettle in Paris" is sometimes how folks with excellent critical thinking skills approach a problem. Try to find a clever but potentially challenging solution and then execute on it, iterating along the way. There's often opportunities to learn new skills, or apply a skill from some other aspect of life. It could also lead to temporary disaster (blown circuit) or worse (the entire residence burns down). Largely speaking, it's also "interesting" to use critical thinking skills.

The second idea is boring, obvious and truly better than the first idea. Even if you're a licensed electrician, the second idea is better in almost every way except that it is not "interesting". 

This is an example (albeit contrived) of where critical thinking can lead to undesirable paths. Sometimes we want the intellectual challenge of one approach, even if it's not actually helpful or efficient. Sometimes the boring, obvious way _is_ the better way. 

Intelligent people can fall into this trap in several ways (see: most software development) but also not even really see there's a trap in the first place. The easy solution _should_ be easy, but we can forget that as smart people. The _hard_ solution may seem hard but tractable, a challenge we can arise to conquer. 

Sometimes, it's actually just hard.
