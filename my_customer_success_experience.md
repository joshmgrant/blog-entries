In my current role, I work on a [customer success](https://sixteenventures.com/customer-success-playbook) team. Before this, I've had limited experience working with customer success or client services organizations. I would like to share my first real interaction with a client services - as a customer. I feel like this story captures what customer success is really all about.

A few years back, my wife was travelling to New York City for a business trip. She was going to be gone for maybe two or three days, and she was staying at a hotel arranged by her company. It was one of her first business trips away, and I wanted to do something nice for her. I found the hotel, checked their website, and found an email contact for the concierge. I emailed the concierge saying I'd like to have a bottle of wine arranged to my wife's room and provided the relevant details about her name and stay. The concierge replied with maybe two or three options (along with prices). I chose having one bottle of red wine wrapped up in cellophane and left in her room for her first night there. I also was able to pay separately from her trip payment arrangements. 

When my wife arrived, she found the wine and told me what a nice surprise it was. Overall the entire transaction went beautifully. 

This is an excellent example of a customer service interaction, because

- this was a post-sales transaction - the hotel stay was already chosen, arranged, and paid for by someone else,
- a particular service was available post-sales and was honoured - having a concierge provide a service for my wife on my behalf and receiving a clear response to my request, and
- an interaction was available on the customer's terms - I was able to reach out by email and was able to handle the transaction along side the previous sales transaction.

As someone who works with customer success managers / client service managers (CSMs) and is client facing at times, I now appreciate how smoothly this transaction was and in turn how badly it could've been botched. 

Some ways it could've been a bad customer success or client service story: 

- I could've made my request and been directed back to either have my wife handle the request or her place of business make the request (forcing me to go through a sales process instead of post-sales)
- The concierge could've ignored my request or given a vague response (not honouring their advertised services)
- Telling me I would have to call or visit the hotel to make arrangements, or they'd accept something I arranged with another vendor such as gift basket company or wine seller (not working on my terms).

Luckily none of this happened. Of course there's some other ways this process could've gone sideways on me but I'm trying to highlight how the hotel offered a good customer success experience above all. Once again, I wasn't _sold_ anything myself, I simply wanted to _make use of the services available_ to my wife. There's a subtle difference, and think this difference between being sold something versus taking advantage of a previously sold service is how customer success organizations can really flourish.
