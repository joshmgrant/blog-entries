Should you use Cypress or Selenium for testing a particular feature on a browser? 

When should you use a mock in a test?

The test automation pyramid is a popular model for designing automated tests, but it's now many years old. Is it still valid? 

Is it worth it to parallelize unit test executions?

If you're a software developer and you read the above questions and thought "I don't actually know", then perhaps you need some help from _test developers_. 

[Test development is development](https://simplythetest.tumblr.com/post/169623787610/test-developers-arent-testers), but more importantly, test developers are developers who specialize in all aspects of test automation, from tool choice to test design. Like developers who specialize in security or database administration, test development is a specialty.

I think this is hugely important as automation and testing are becoming more and more common aspects of software development. Modern developers not only write and run automated tests alongside their app development work, but also may want particularly tools in order to facilitate better test automation practices. Teams of one person, or one hundred people, may have questions around good practices with test automation. Test developers can look at the context available and make recommendations and/or create test code to help with teams' requests.
