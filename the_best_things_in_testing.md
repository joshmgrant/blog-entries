It's been said that the best things in life aren't things. The spirit of this proverb is that the most enjoyable things in life aren't phyiscal goods but experiences or emotions. The feeling you get watching a beautiful sunset on a memorable vacation more important than the physical photograph you have framed of the sunset. Largely, there's a lot of truth to this statement. 

When it comes to test automation, perhaps it's also true that the best things in test automation aren't tests. 

Naturally I believe that writing good test automation is a benefit to any software team or project. But I also believe there's some practices that can help test automation that are essentially independent of test automation strategy or quality.
