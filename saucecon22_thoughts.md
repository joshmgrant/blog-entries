It has been a hot minute since I've blogged - for several reasons including juggling child care, pandemic-related changes, and a busy time at work -  and this week was [SauceCon](https://saucecon.com) which I was fortunate enough to be a part of. It got me thinking about some things, so here they are in no particular order:

- Virtual conferences are still just ok compared to real-life conferences, even if well-executed
- Seriously, if you are a developer and you want to really level up your skill-set, join a sales team or customer-facing role.
- High school english classes were probably the most helpful education I've had in terms of skills I use on a regular basis.
- Low-code tools - for software testing or otherwise - are here and some of them are actually good, so get used to it.
- A while back during a conversation with software developers, one developer commented that every good software tool choice depends on the context. Sometimes I needed to be reminded of that.
- "Just use Selenium" is not a testing strategy. Not even close. You need more than a tool or piece of software.
- Also for the love of all things Good, please treat parallelization (or [p15y](https://twitter.com/edward_gibbs/status/120639247609901056?s=20&t=6K6oYHLUwzX-Bpcd48knPA)) a  first class feature of your test automation
- There's something good about [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/), the community, that translates to Robot Framework, the tool somehow.
- Totally my personal opinion and experience, but I'm not really a fan of tools with a vertical learning curve.
- It is _mind blowing_ what can be done with software these days with _minimal effort_, from a software engineering perspective. 
- If you're not paying attention to [Kelsey Hightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower), [Maaret Pyhäjärvi](https://maaretp.com/), [Nikolay Advolodkin](https://twitter.com/nikolay_a00), [Titus Fortner](https://titusfortner.com/) or [Angie Jones](https://angiejones.tech/), you should really start doing that.
