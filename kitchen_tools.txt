I like to cook. If you opened up one of my kitchen drawers or took a look at the shelves in my kitchen, you'll find a whole bunch of tools and gadgets. 

Some of these tools I use daily or even more often (spatula, tongs, chef knife). 

Some of these tools I use less than daily, but still pretty frequently (can opener, vegetable peeler, microwave). 

Some of these tools I don't use very often, but are very helpful when I use them (lobster claw crackers). 

And some of these tools I barely use. I'm not even sure why I have them (avocado slicer). 

The point of all of these tools, however, is to help me make great meals. When I'm thinking about preparing dinner, I haver never once thought "How can I use /all/ of the items in this drawer?". In fact, that idea just seems silly. I've also thought things like "What can I make using my new food processor?", and followed through on them, usually with mixed success (hummus, or variants thereof). 

Most often, I have thought "How can make a tasty meal?". That's why I have this kitchen full of tools. And that's the goal these tools are meant to accomplish.
