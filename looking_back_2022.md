If I had to rate every year of my life from best to worst, 2022 would be somewhere in the lower quartiles. This year was not easy, but not terrible. Here's my post on reflecting on what was 2022

General
- It may seem trite, but "plan it, and execute it" is still awfully good life advice. I revisisted this advice several times this year with good results each time.
- Similarly, "be proactive, not reactive" is much better advice when you're in a position of power more than weakness.
- As a Canadian who has had a lot of interactions with US Americans and Europeans, let me say that US culture is _exhausting_. 
- There's a lot more to a kitchen renovation than picking out a countertop colour.
- Weirdly, keeping a somewhat consistent blog for many years is actually a bit of a blessing these days.
- To paraphrase Kurt Vonnegut, peculiar travel destinations are dancing lessions from God.
- One of the best books I've readin a while is [Braiding Sweetgrass](https://milkweed.org/book/braiding-sweetgrass) by Robin Wall Kimmerer. It's definitely one of those "read it slow and let the thoughts sink in" kind of reads. Highly recommended.


Parenting
- These [two](https://www.thecut.com/2022/11/finding-joy-for-my-kids-in-the-apocalypse.html) [articles](https://www.thecut.com/2022/11/essay-rsv-covid-flu-surge.html) on the difficulty of parenting during COVID and other crises really hit home for me. One of the things that made this year difficult was simply _managing_ parenting through illness, rotating school closures and ambiguous child care situations. This management was draining, slowly but surely, in ways that Amil Niazi and Lydia Kiesling capture perfectly.
- Two year olds are a lot of fun, a lot of work, and just a lot overall.
- Something wonderful about having a kid grow up is seeing how they get into the same kinds of things that you were into at their age. Video games and science are just as fun the second time around.
- The notion of "bad parenting" is possibly an badly defined concept. I'm not exactly sure how to quantify how bad a parent is doing given the circumstances of the past few years. 

Software Development
- More and more I'm convinced that the next "big thing" in software development tooling (if it isn't the big thing already) is User/Developer Experience. There are many, many great software tools that are simply crappy to use.
- GUI automation still remains one of the most difficult parts of software engineering, talking about mobile environments or otherwise.
- Test automation is such a wonderful software speciality to me because it lets me play in a bunch of different discpline's backyards. For example, I would have never learned about [automated cow brushes](https://youtu.be/K7yDrLCoLwU) if it weren't for my test automation career.
- Probably my favourite podcast as of late is [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/) hosted by Michael Kennedy and Brian Okken. What I truly love about it is the format: two prominent people in the Python world just talking about cool Python modules and tools. I feel like we need more of this in the software world.
- This upcoming year might finally be when I dig into some genuinely new programming languages (for me). I'm cautiously optimistic.
- I've thought about it, and articles and presentations with clickbait titles such as "Tool X vs Tool Y: Who will Win?" or somesuch are fine, actually. 
- When I'm old and grey and look back at my life and legacy, I probably will not be thinking of C++ software development.

Tech
- To be blunt: there's a lot of shitty white men leaders in Silicon Valley. And it shows.
- Related to the previous point: true diversity and inclusion on teams is a major, massive advantage.
- One of the most interesting lessons I've learned over the past several years is that being a CEO is still a job. CEOs can be more junior or senior, have growth trajectories and learning goals, and still have day-to-day work to do.
- I was a part of the great tech layoffs of '22 (my last day was during Burning Man, no less). It was a humbling experience, but it also taught me a lot about the nature of the tech industry. In a strange way, I'm grateful for this.
- Once again, with some feeling: the decision to replace humans with automation is a managerial one, not a technological one.
- Never underestimate the value of a good community.
- Related to the previous point: just because something is difficult to quantify doesn't mean it has no value. And just because high up decision makers don't understand the value doesn't mean there isn't any.
- Developers really, really hate being marketed to. Honestly, I think this is a good thing.
- Something that may be missing from open source software and perhaps corporate software is the idea of helping. Having an expert or someone with experience in an area different from yours genuinely offer help can be very rewarding, but this isn't promoted too much. It's a bit of a shame.

Canadiana
- This year was (in my opinion) a record low-point for Canadian politicians. They basically all decided to phone it in.
- Queen Elizabeth passing finally provided two things that united most Canadians together: an elaborate royal funeral with all the commentary and commotion, and a distaste for the now King Charles III.
- One of the podcasts I've listened to in the past year was [Canadaland COMMONS on the Hudson's Bay Company](https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/monopoly-3-the-hudsons-bay-company/). It was a really good introduction to a long and storied company that really influenced the development of "Canada" as a nation.
- Canada really is, historically and culturally, about seven corporations dressed in a trenchcoat.
