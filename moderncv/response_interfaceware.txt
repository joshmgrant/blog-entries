Good morning. I am Joshua Grant, and I recently applied to for the C++ Developer position. As I have seen the position posted on Craigslist again on February 22, I thought I would follow up. I have included my resume and cover letter with some minor revisions of some errors I found on my previous submission, an indication of my desire to constantly improve myself. Thank you for your consideration.
