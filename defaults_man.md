In 2019, the Toronto Raptors won their first NBA championship. It was an amazing moment for Toronto sports fans and the city itself. One of the major reasons the Raptors won the championship was [Kawhi Leonard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard). 

Kawhi is known for his work ethic and dedication to his game. One story which got some traction in the 2019 playoffs was that Kawhi used to repeat the phrase ["board man gets paid"](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/06/nba-finals-kawhi-leonard-board-man) every time he got a rebound when he was practicing and playing in high school and college. In basketball, getting a rebound to take possession is nicknamed getting a "board". Kawhi focused on getting boards so he could progress to the NBA. It turned out that this approach worked, and Kawhi would sometime colourfully be called "board man". 

At this point, I'd like to say I'm a "defaults man".
