I have some thoughts about test automation and UI automation. 

Recently [an article recommending against writing automated UI end-to-end tests](http://nickywtester.blogspot.ca/2017/10/lets-stop-writing-automated-end-to-end.html) came my way. It's a good post and I've read (and [written](http://simplythetest.tumblr.com/post/85247125825/gui-automation-still-sucks)) posts like this before. 

In fact, after re-reading a great post from Alan Page arguing that [testers should stop writing UI automation](http://angryweasel.com/blog/stop-writing-automation/), I have to say I agree with Alan's opinion with one caveat: testers should stop writing UI automation, _but that doesn't meant UI automation shouldn't be written_. 

I'll readily agree that UI automation is pretty challenging. Web and mobile app UI automation is pretty tough -- and desktop app UI automation is truly one of the most challenging areas of software engineering I can imagine. Writing good UI automated tests is hard. Maintaining test suites is hard. Scaling up UI test suites from a small number to a large number of tests is hard. Debugging tests and gathering useful information from test failures is hard. Almost everything about UI automation is hard.

But this doesn't mean UI automated tests shouldn't be written. A high cost doesn't imply a low benefit-cost ratio. 

The real issue here stems from one of two issues that often arise after some
