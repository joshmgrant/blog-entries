In the cinematic masterpiece [_Monty Python and the Holy Grail_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/), there comes a point where King Arthur and his band of knights find themselves needing to cross The Bridge of Death, "a bridge that no man has ever crossed" as part of their quest to find the holy grail. This particular bridge located on the other side of a cave "that no man has ever entered". Of course crossing the bridge - and I guess entering the cave - puts the knights in tremendous peril. 

Naturally, this situation is applicable to many browser-based test automation projects.

In many medium-to-enterprise scale test automation projects (in the sense of [these definitions](http://simplythetest.tumblr.com/post/167348508070/how-big-is-your-ui-automation-project) I've written about) there comes a crucial point in the project history where there is some dangerous bridge to cross. This crossing could take several forms such as a high priority release that will use extensive automated testing for the first time, major infrastructural changes in response to new app code, or a point of realization that the "wrong" tooling was chosen for test automation. The dangerous bridge is dangerous in part because even the strong team members in such a project don't really know how to cross this bridge or what's even on the other side. And don't forget that it's usually easier to simply end (internal-facing) test automation projects than to save them. Not being able to show value for a project without taking the risks of that project can put some test automation efforts into an unusual Catch 22 situation. 

Crossing such a bridge of death may also occur after entering a metaphorical cave that no one on a test automation team may have ever seen before. This compounds feelings of risk and anxiety around test automation efforts. 

Bridges of death can be traversed however, and people may even live to tell the tail of success on doing so. Here are some ideas for making this treacherous journey less treacherous: 

- Set clear goals and stick to them: Clear goals can provide direction even in times of uncertainty. Having long-term vs short-term goals can also help give some structure to how well a test project is going over time.
- Be decisive: In the case of choosing tooling that doesn't work for a team in the long-run, it can be very easy to point blame or try to hack around tooling problems. In this case, be ruthless and make the changes you need to even if there is short-term pain. If you know what needs to be done, then commit to doing it.
- Follow good software practices: Test code is production code and should be treated as such. Similar to test automation projects, which are software projects. Give your project the same respect any other professional software project has.

Thinking about the bridge of death and being brave in the face of it on your quest may reach your holy grail, and not end up in a muddle of police officers and knights in a marsh.
