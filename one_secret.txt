As someone who's worked as a software professional for the past few years, I'd like to share a secret. It's a secret that will help increase your test coverage, make testing more efficient, reduce maintenance on documentation and automated checks within your project. It also requires little tooling and no knowledge of Context-Driven Testing frameworks and no ISTQB certifications. It also works effectively for both junior and senior developers within an organization.

Ready? 

Whenever you want to increase your test coverage, do the following: 

Open your app and go to areas that haven't been tested. Then do stuff in the app in these areas. Then observe the result.

That's it. No Selenium or [Continuous Integration](https://storify.com/joshin4colours/ci-server) required! 

This might sound trivial, but it really does help. It's easy to get caught up in any of the concepts I mentioned in this post to the point where developers, testers and managers aren't even sure what an app is doing at a given point in time. Take a look at what the app you're working with is _actually_ doing.
