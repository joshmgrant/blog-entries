I'm a Python guy. It's a good language and has a decent community. Since I also happen to live in the modern work, I've also worked with NodeJS a fair bit over the past few years. Node has a large community and there is a lot to love - and hate - in the JavaScript language. I don't truly _love_ NodeJS but I can work with it.

However, one thing that I do really enjoy about NodeJS is that in virtually every NodeJS project you get started with three little words (well, ok, command line expressions):

```bash
npm install
npm start
npm test
```

You can optionally think of there being a `git clone ...` command before those commands as well, but I'd like to focus on the NodeJS specific commands. 

This may seem like a small, even trivial, aspect of NodeJS to call out as a benefit, but I'd disagree. I think the simplicity of those three little words are what make NodeJS project easy to get started with and in turn what make people want to contribute to the NodeJS world.
