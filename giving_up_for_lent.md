Since we're coming up to the beginning of [Lent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent), I often think about things to "give up" in the spirit of self-improvement. This year, here's some things I'm giving up related to my work as a test developer: 

- Discussing whether testers should learn to code: it's 2018 and anyone can download [a](https://www.python.org/downloads/) [good](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) [programming](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) [language](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/index.html) package and find tutorials online fairly easily. You can even execute JavaScript directly in Chrome. The decision of whether a tester should code or not is a false choice; coding and programming is ubiquitous in software development and almost anyone working in software will encounter some form of it at some point. You may as well discuss whether testers should learn how to use an email client. While learning to code may not be directly applicable to some testers' jobs or career prospects, coding should be treated like any other basic skill a tester may encounter. 

- Distinguishing between testing and checking: while at first the notion of "testing vs checking" has some interesting philosophical implications, ultimately I think this distinction doesn't really help software development professionals. Whether you want to call automated tests "checks" for purposes of discussion is fine with - I'll respect that decision that others make - but overall I don't think testing vs checking a helpful distinction. Constructing and maintaining automated tests and test harnesses can greatly improve a software team's quality and output and often has significant overlap with testing activities. As well, separating specific approaches as checking an app or testing an app doesn't seem to have a lot of on-the-job benefit for testers. Creating a hard separation between these things doesn't seem to have much benefit, in my experience.

- Bashing UI Automation: One opinion I'm coming around to is that UI automation isn't as terrible as people make it out to be. I've [written posts bashing UI automation](http://simplythetest.tumblr.com/post/85247125825/gui-automation-still-sucks), and often (G)UI automation projects are badly formulated and fail hard. But the problem isn't that UI automation is inherently bad. It's that there's too much of it or those responsible for it don't have the expertise to make it work well. There is a lot of benefit of having automated testing "below" the UI (integration tests, service tests, unit tests, etc) but there's benefit to UI automated tests as well, if done well. Instead of ragging on how bad UI automated testing is, I'm going to embrace UI automation and browser automated testing in particular and give these ideas some love.

Before I get to all of this giving up, I'll enjoy some delicious [pancakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrove_Tuesday).
