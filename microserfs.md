Ideas based on working in tech

- Makes sense there's lots of downtime while working at Microsoft
- Plus release cycles probably meant days off after the launch
- I've been to the MGM Grand in Vegas, the Luxor, McCarran airport, Hyatt Regency SFO, Burlingame, on the BART, but never to the UW student pub
- So $23,000 in around 1995 in the US is about $47,000 today. Microsoft stock in the same time period was about $4-5. Tech workers were NOT making the bucks they are today.
- Everyone in the book seems like a genuinely nice enough person. Even Bug at the beginning of the book seems a bit problematic but still fine.
- Dan seems like a pretty decent guy, overall
- Karla seems very smart. I'm not even sure if Dan really picks up on this.
- Somehow, tech startup culture is kind of the same from an employee's/financial perspective: you're either in a super new start-up with about 4 people working doing who knows what making almost no money, or a slightly more mature place with actual roles and some structure and a bit of money, or a later-stage startup that's fairly big and everyone wants to cash out.
- It's revealed that Dan grew up in Palo Alto and that both parents had decent jobs. This is a substantial amount of privilege that no way in heck I would've seen in school reading this. No wonder they can go months without pay! They're a garage company!
- Honestly the Habitrail was kind of cool when I read Microserfs in High School but now it just seems...a little gross?
- Bug coming out really does hit me harder now. It's just so great he found himself! It's a nice story of how someone can still be finding themselves even after their 20s or 30s.
- So many ideas really came to life out of Microserfs: emailing friends on a routine basis catch up (instant messaging), "multimedia" taking over (modern internet), the Net picking up. And Oop! is basically Minecraft, so there.
- They're always buying so much computer hardware! RAM, memory, wires and cables, even printers in some cases. All the time! Now we use sealed up laptops and phones.
- I'm actually very glad that there was a truly happy ending for Oop and all of the employee characters.
- Susan and Chyx was actually super cool because those women-first or women-only hacker groups still exist in Silicon Valley. I think that's awesome.
- California is a lovely place. Just driving or walking around the Bay area or Southern California along the coast is great. It's not surprising there's lots of that.
- I can't believe Michael tells Dan about BarCode in the Hyatt Regency SFO. When I was a kid I thought that Michael and Dan go to some random cafe or restaurant. I've not only been to the Hyatt I stayed there for four nights for work a couple of years ago. I gave a workshop and had a client meeting on Friday before that so I was able to make a weekend out of it. I probably ate at the table that Michael and Dan sat at!
- Ethan is such a mess, like truly a mess.
