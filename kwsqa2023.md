Thoughts on KWSQA 2023

It's been a heck of a few years for me, personally and professionally. One thing that I am grateful for is returning to Targeting Quality 2023, the annual conference held by [KWSQA](https://kwsqa.org/). This year the conference was held in Cambridge, Ontario. Here are my thoughts on it. 

## Overall
- The testing community is still a great community. Attendees were engaged, and even as someone who's done primarily test development for his career I was still able to have great discussions with testers about all kinds of topics. 

## The Talks
- The first talk of the day on Presentation day that I saw was Bas Dijkstra's [How well do you wield your tools? - The importance of craftsmanship in test automation](https://kwsqa.org/tq2023/schedule/presenters-day-2-keynote-and-talks/#a1) which was a part of the automation track. One of the key messages in this talk was that test automation _can_ and _should_ be treated like production software development, which is something I've been saying for a [long time](https://simplythetest.tumblr.com/post/52345545065/test-development-is-development). It is good to hear that this message is still coming through strong.
- Test automation is definitely a mainstream topic in software development, but there's still so much that can be done by application developers in terms of test automation. Concepts like property-based testing, contract testing and security testing are all highly relevant for test development.
- Fuzz testing: still not a common topic outside of the security engineering world
- Another talk that I enjoyed was [The Automation Firehose](https://kwsqa.org/tq2023/schedule/presenters-day-2-keynote-and-talks#s3) by Thomas Haver of M&T Bank. This talk gave a great overview of how to think about growing and scaling test automation teams with a superhero theme.
- Ben Oconis' talk on breaking down silos in organizations sparked some thoughts from me and [folks online](https://mastodon.social/@joshin4colours/111093061146608594) about the role of "test specialist" in software organizations. Ben's talk was really good at outlining some organizational aspects to quality, which aren't necessarily "testing" skills but important nonetheless.
- On this note, software testing is still a great place to learn about good team building practices. Lean Coffee, for example, is an excellent format for getting engaged folks to talk about a few different subjects in an effective (and time efficient!) manner. There were two sessions of lean coffee lead by [Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory](https://agiletestingfellow.com/). I attended one of these sessions, and I can't recommend trying lean coffee enough.
- My favourite talk of the conference was the keynote, simply entitled [STAIRS!](https://kwsqa.org/tq2023/schedule/presenters-day-2-keynote-and-talks/#kn) by Jenny Bramble and Jenna Charlton. Entertaining and insightful, Jenny and Jenna show great examples of cognitive biases and how they can effect how products get designed using examples of stair designs (some of which were hilarious bad). This keynote showed that people in the testing community are digging into concepts such as design thinking and how that impacts testing work and quality, and doing so ahead of other in the software development world.

## The Conference
- I have to say: this is one of the best run conferences I have attended. Targeting Quality was 2 days this year, one day of workshops (which I did not attend but heard good things about) and one day of presentations.
- The venue was well-prepared and suitable for the purpose, right down to stacks of pens and notepads available all over the place.
- Food and drink was great, including delicious Portugese-style custard tarts at breakfast (a local delicacy, in my opinion)
- The talks and schedule were well-organized and everything ran pretty much on time throughout the day. This is an underappreciated aspect of any conference, large or small.

Overall, this conference offered a lot of benefits for attendees and speakers. The hall-way track was lively, talks were great quality and speakers were well taken care of. The KWSQA board and Tina Fletcher should receive a round of applause for a great job.
