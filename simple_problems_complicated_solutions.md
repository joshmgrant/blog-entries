By now, you've probably wondered why I'm [@joshin4colours](https://twitter.com/joshin4colours) on Twitter. Mainly it's because I've always liked the [Four Colour Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem#Precise_formulation_of_the_theorem). I think this is an excellent example of a simple problem with a complicated solution. I like these kinds of problems and have always found them fascinating. 

Simple problems with complicated solutions have three characteristics that I enjoy:

1. This is a well-defined problem with a clear solution.
1. The problem can be stated clearly and briefly without 
needing a lot of technical expertise. Often the problem is a bit interesting.
2. The solution is the opposite of this: it requires deep explanation and understanding of complex topics and is markedly not too interesting to non-experts.

The four colour theroem fits this description. 

The problem is simple: Given any map of regions - a map of countries of Europe in the 1600s, a map of Canadian provinces today, a ficticious map of an imaginary content, and so on - only four colours are required to colour the map such that no two regions coloured the same colour share a border. Take a look at any map or atlas and you'll find that there's only a few colours used but countries have this property. 

This problem can be stated more precisely using graph theory, which is where this problem falls into from a mathematical perspective. 

If this seems reasonable and intuitive, the solution is not. 

There's a long history of folks trying to prove this theorem only to have their proof shown false. In the 1970s a proof was found and was one of the first computer-assisted proofs in mathematics. This caused quite a stir because some mathematicians didn't "believe" in computer assisted proofs. There's even been work to make the original proof easier to understand. As wel, the proof is pretty long and pretty difficult to understand.

I think I like problems like this beacuse they can function as a conversation starter but also a complete thought. Talking about the four colour theorem passes the "cocktail party test": it may be an interesting thing to mention at a cocktail party with fancy, interesting other people. (I would probably wave away the solution, however, at such an event, or take the opportunity to get a snack.) As a topic that's an introduction to other topics, such as graph theory or computer-assisted proofs, the four colour theorem also works well. 

Other topics fit this description as well, so I'll wait and see what other tantalizing topics come my way.
