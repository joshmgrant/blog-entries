I think that diversity in IT/tech will be The Next Big Thing, if it isn't already. 

Basically, some people are realizing that tech is - mostly - not very diverse. This generally means that individuals who work in the tech sector don't vary much in terms of socioeconomic class, race, gender, physical attributes or location of origin. Some prominent companies have started either [tracking their workforce diversity](http://fortune.com/2015/06/01/google-diversity-demographics/) and perhaps even having [business initiatives towards increasing diversity](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/07/30/pinterest-diversity-women-underrepresented-minorities-silicon-valley-jesse-jackson/30881091/). I think this is largely a good thing. Software is becoming more and more part of people's lives, and we need individuals from all kinds of backgrounds to help build software that works beyond a small group of particular individuals. I also think that good software development puts [less focus on writing code and more focus on solving problems](http://simplythetest.tumblr.com/post/124342020350/software-support-and-everything-else) and having a diverse team helps accomplish this.

On the other hand, like other Big Ideas in tech, there will be good implementations and bad implementations, well-meaning ideas that are poorly executed and badly-intentioned ideas that end up being well-executed. In this way, it's similar to Agile. Let's hope that some good comes out of this whatever the case will be.
